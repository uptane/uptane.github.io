# History

**2010**: A predecessor technology of Uptane, The Update Framework (TUF), which
secures software updates on repositories, is introduced in an [academic research paper](../../static/papers/samuel_ccs_2010.pdf),
coauthored by Justin Samuel and Justin Cappos.

**2013**: Cappos, along with Trishank Kuppusamy, and Vladimir Diaz begin
adapting TUF for Python, Ruby, and environments used
for cloud computing. Kuppusamy, a Ph.D. student at the time, will later
use this experience on the Uptane project.

**2015**: [NYU Tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) receives a grant (with
Cappos as PI) from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to begin work on
a project to secure software updates on vehicles. [University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute](https://umtri.umich.edu/)(UMTRI)
and [Southwest Research Institute](https://www.swri.org/)(SWRI) receive a
similar grant to work on automotive security.

**2016**: A consortium of researchers at
UMTRI, SWRI, and NYU Tandon begin developing Uptane, using the basic
TUF design as a starting point.

**2016** The research team also begins holding a series of workshops (organized by
Andre Weimerskirch at UMTRI) at which auto companies, suppliers, and representatives of government agencies
meet to review and comment on the work in progress. The team also establishes an online forum,
where issues could be raised and discussed. Both of these steps help to ensure
alignment with the intended market.

**2016**: [_Uptane: Securing Software Updates for Automobiles_](../../static/papers/kuppusamy_escar_16.pdf)
is presented at [escar 16](https://www.escar.info/escar-europe/history.html) by
lead author Kuppusamy. This
marked the first presentation of the project to an academic audience.

**2017**: Uptane is officially introduced at [press events](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/01/19/uptane-will-protect-your-connected-car-from-hackers/#233b99d019be) in Ann Arbor, MI, and Brooklyn, NY.

**2017**: Advanced Telematic Systems (ATS), now [HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/),
becomes one of the first suppliers to publicly [acknowledge adoption](https://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2017/06/connected-car-news-marvell-telit-att-ats-continental-toyota-marvel-safe-drive-systems-cast-car2go-trimble/) of Uptane when it integrates the framework
into two of its OTA solutions, OTA Plus and ATS Garage.

**2017**: Uptane is named one of the year's most important security innovations
by [_Popular Science_](https://www.popsci.com/top-security-innovations-2017/).

**2018**: [Airbiquity](https://www.airbiquity.com) receives a
[BIG Award for Business](https://www.airbiquity.com/news/press-releases/airbiquity-otamatic-named-2017-new-product-year-business-intelligence-group) in the 2017 New Product of the Year Award category for its
Uptane-based OTAmatic over-the-air software and data management solution.

**2018**: An open source, C++ implementation of Uptane called [aktualizr](https://github.com/uptane/aktualizr)
is developed by Advanced Telematic Systems (subsequently acquired by
[HERE technologies](https://www.here.com/en)). aktualizr
is integrated into [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/) (AGL),
a collaborative open source project in which
automakers, suppliers and technology companies work together to advance the
development and adoption of a fully open software stack for the connected car.

**2018**: NYU Tandon School of Engineering becomes an associate member of the
[Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and a Bronze member of AGL
on the strength of the Foundationâ€™s adoption of Uptane and TUF projects.

**2018**: The Uptane Alliance, a nonprofit entity organized under the umbrella of
IEEE's [International Standards and Technology Organization](https://ieee-isto.org/) is formed.
As an ISTO supported organization, the Alliance will oversee the development of
a Standard for the implementation/deployment of Uptane, as well as the
advancement and improvement of the technology itself.

**2019**: IEEE/ISTO releases version 1.0.0 of the Uptane specification.

**2019**: The Uptane Alliance joins the Linux Foundation's Joint Development Foundation, giving the project
a pathway for ISO standardization of future versions of the Standard.

**2021**: The Uptane working group releases versions 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 of the Uptane Standard.

**2021**: Uptane releases its first whitepaper [Uptane: Securing delivery of software updates for
ground vehicles](https://uptane.github.io/papers/Uptane_first_whitepaper.pdf). A [Japanese language version](https://uptane.github.io/papers/uptane_first_japanese_92121.pdf) is released later in the year.

**2021**: A formal method for members of the community to propose the addition or modification of the Uptane specification, known as Proposed Uptane Revision and Enhancement or PUREs, is established. To date, PUREs have introduced to Uptane a secure method for handling offline updates, and a strategy to addressing software supply chain security in Uptane.

**2021**: In conjunction with escar Europe, Uptane holds its first virtual International Conference, drawing attendees from Europe and Asia.

**2022**: Version 2.0.0 of the Uptane Standard is released. The most significant change in this version is the removal of references to the Uptane Time Server to clarify that users can make their own decisions about secure sources of time.

**2023**: Version 2.1.0 of the Uptane Standard is released.
