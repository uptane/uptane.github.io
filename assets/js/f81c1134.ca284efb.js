For a number of years now, we\'ve seen adoption of Uptane in other sectors that have high security requirements, like robotics, civil infrastructure, and industrial automation. In the embedded Linux space, for example, [Torizon Cloud](https://www.torizon.io/) has been providing Uptane-as-a-service for IoT and industrial automation for years. Any domain where you want security, software/firmware updates to multiple independent compute units or components, reliable and secure software manifests, or secure offline updates is a good domain to implement Uptane in.\\n\\nBut I\'m writing today about a major new piece of legislation from the European Union: the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). It was adopted without changes [last week](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/10/10/cyber-resilience-act-council-adopts-new-law-on-security-requirements-for-digital-products/) by the Council of the EU, meaning it will enter into force very shortly--the remaining steps are merely procedural, such as publishing official translations in the EU\'s legislative journal. The CRA\'s requirements talk a lot about software updates, though, and it looks like Uptane is a perfect way to meet those requirements.\\n\\n## What is the Cyber Resilience Act? Why now?\\n\\nThe Cyber Resilience Act is no joke: it imposes serious new cybersecurity requirements on any product with digital elements offered for sale anywhere in the European Union, and serious fines for any manufacturer (or importer) selling that don\'t comply. The EU looked at the landscape of cybersecurity in IoT, consumer electronics, industrial control systems, and more, and found it to be seriously lacking. Devices get shipped with ancient firmwares rife with security holes, and never get patched. Those devices end up getting compromised by cyber-criminals, and causing trouble not just for the people who bought them, but for the whole world: botnets of [millions of compromised IoT devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)) are one of the biggest vectors for DDOS attacks, for example.\\n\\nBut market forces don\'t do a great job of incentivizing good cybersecurity practices, unfortunately. The average consumer has no way to tell the difference between IoT products with good cybersecurity practices and bad ones, and it\'s a lot cheaper to _claim_ to be secure than to actually put in the work to be secure.\\n\\nSo what can be done when market forces are failing, and profit motives are causing negative externalities? Regulation, with steep penalties for bad actors. Selling products that turn into botnets because it\'s cheaper not to patch actively exploited security holes isn\'t all that different from dumping dangerous chemicals into a stream because it\'s cheaper than disposing of them properly. With the CRA\'s penalties of up to 2.5% of global annual revenue (or 15 million euros, whichever is higher), the profitability equation drastically changes.\\n\\n![](cra-pillars.png)\\n\\nThe CRA has three main pillars. The first pillar is product-related essential requirements, the second is mandating continuing responsibility for handling security issues and vulnerabilities after the product is sold, and the third relates to properly informing end users about support periods and other important cybersecurity features. I\'m going to look only at the first two pillars here.\\n\\nA surprising portion of the new concrete requirements under the CRA relate to software updates. That shouldn\'t be a surprise to most cybersecurity professionals: exploits happen, and when they do, they need to be patched. The fact that so many connected devices ship without a software update system, or with an insecure or incomplete software update system, is the root cause of a lot of problems. For those reasons, some of the CRA\'s most detailed and specific requirements relate to software updates.\\n\\n## Uptane and the CRA: A natural fit\\n\\nSo, we have a major new regulation that mandates broad adoption of over-the-air software update systems. Uptane was developed to be a secure over-the-air software update system against an incredibly strong threat model; one of the talks that Prof. Cappos would often give in the early years of Uptane was entitled [Securing Over-the-Air Updates Against Nation State Actors](https://ossalsjp18.sched.com/event/EaXX/securing-over-the-air-updates-against-nation-state-actors-justin-cappos-nyu). So it\'s not surprising that Uptane is a natural choice for meeting CRA obligations.\\n\\n### Software update client requirements\\n\\nLet\'s look at some of those concrete requirements. First off, software updates are absolutely mandatory:\\n\\n> Products shall:\\n> * ensure that vulnerabilities can be addressed [\u2026] through automatic security updates that are enabled as a default setting\\n\\nThis requirement clearly indicates the need for an _active_ update system. It is not sufficient, for example, to publish a software update and notify the user that it\'s available. The product itself needs to be able to automatically check for and install security updates. But of course, automatic updates are themselves potentially a serious attack vector. But the CRA\'s framers understand the same thing that the automotive industry does: automatic updates are themselves an extremely dangerous attack vector. So it also prescribes that these updates need to be distributed securely:\\n\\n> Products shall:\\n> * provide for mechanisms to securely distribute updates [\u2026] in an automatic manner\\n\\nHere, and throughout the regulation, the CRA doesn\'t delve into specifics. EU-level regulation tends to be written in common-sense, plain language; the details of what it means for an mechanism of distributing updates to be secure is left up to the experts. But clearly, applying a known and established standard like Uptane is one of the best ways to ensure compliance. Software update security isn\'t an easy problem, and many high-profile, real-world software update systems have had major compromises over the years. Rolling your own update system is usually a bad idea.\\n\\n### Vulnerability monitoring and per-device requirements\\n\\nThe CRA mandates a _support period_ for every product of at least 5 years. During the support period, you are responsible for reviewing the security of the software on the product, and ensuring that any exploitable vulnerability of the product is patched without delay:\\n\\n> Manufacturers of products with digital elements shall:\\n> * in relation to the risks posed to products with digital elements, address and remediate vulnerabilities without delay, including by providing security updates\\n> * apply effective and regular tests and reviews of the security of the product with digital elements\\n\\nObviously having a reliable, flexible, and secure software update system is a prerequisite for meeting these requirements. But there\'s another issue: under the CRA, you might have different support obligations for different products, even of the same SKU.\\n\\nThat\'s because the support period is defined by, and starts when, the product is [placed on the market](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52022XC0629(04)#d1e2095-1-1). If you follow that link, you\'ll see the detailed legal definition of what it means to be \\"placed on the market\\" in the European Union, but the crux of it is that (1) \\"placing on the market\\" is a concept that applies to individualized products, not SKUs or product lines, and (2) a product cannot be considered to be placed on the market before it is actually manufactured. That means that you may have different support obligations for different individual products of the same SKU:\\n\\n[![](gantt-chart-sample-lifecycle.png)](gantt-chart-sample-lifecycle.png)\\n\\nOne solution to this issue is simply to extend support to all products of a particular SKU until 5 years after the last one is manufactured. But if that\'s not feasible or desirable, you need a way to accurately determine when your support obligations for each product expire. Uptane\'s signed software manifests provide this: every time a device checks for an update, it sends a manifest. In that manifest, there is a report generated and cryptographically signed by each component of the device detailing exactly what software/firmware it has installed, identified by the software/firmware\'s hash.\\n\\nThis is perfect for tracking support obligations! Even though your product tracking needs might not be as detailed as an automaker\'s, leveraging Uptane\'s built-in reporting mechanism can still help you do compliance tracking. The fact that the reports also tell you exactly what software the devices in the field are running is just an added bonus. The software manifests also let you can keep track of how many devices successfully upgrade when run an update campaign, and will also alert you if malicious software is installed or software is unexpectedly downgraded.\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nThe Cyber Resilience Act is here, and it brings meaningful new requirements. Uptane can help you meet quite a lot of them, because many of the things the CRA requires were already core requirements for Uptane back when we started designing it in 2015. I\'m personally very happy to see these principles make it into law and regulations, because I firmly believe that keeping devices up to date with regular software updates is one of the most effective ways to increase cybersecurity for everyone. But at the same time, automatic software update systems are extremely dangerous if they aren\'t implemented properly. So I very much encourage any device manufacturer that finds itself suddenly in need of an automatic update system to look first at an Uptane-based one. You can implement Uptane yourself, or you can use existing implementations. There are free-as-in-beer, free-as-in-speech, and SaaS offerings available. I already gave a run-down of the various options in [my last blog post](https://uptane.org/blog/2024/02/26/Get-Started-With-Uptane#serversrepositories), so I won\'t repeat myself here. (Full disclosure: I am paid to work on [Torizon Cloud](https://www.torizon.io/), an Uptane-based SaaS offering.)\\n\\nTo offer a slight spin on an [old proverb](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/603690/origins-of-the-phrase-the-best-time-to-plant-a-tree-was-30-years-ago-the-secon): the best time to integrate an Uptane software update system was at the beginning of your product design process.

But even beyond that, Uptane is different from other standards you might read. It doesn\'t specify an exact wireline formats and metadata schema that must be implemented. Furthermore, Uptane kind of sits \\"in the middle\\" on a software update architecture diagram.\\n\\nIn this post, I want to do three things. First, I\'m going to answer the question, \\"Why should I want to use Uptane, and where?\\" Second, I\'m going to give a really high-level overview of what Uptane is. I\'m not going to get into specifics of _how_ Uptane works, I just want to describe what it is, and what it does. And finally, I want to show the easiest way to start using a system that delivers software updates through Uptane by making use of open-source implementations of various parts of an Uptane system.\\n\\n## Why should I use Uptane?\\n\\nUptane isn\'t just for vehicles!\\n\\nUptane was designed as a system to safely and securely deliver software updates to vehicles. That means it was designed to work under some difficult constraints. To begin with, there are dozens of different microcontrollers inside a vehicle, all running software that might need to be updated, and are connected by a number of different buses. There are challenging regulatory requirements, as well. A vehicle might only be road-legal with certain approved firmwares running on safety-critical parts. So you need to make sure that vehicles can report the software they\'re running in a verifiable way, and you need to be able to control the complete set of software and firmware running on the vehicle.\\n\\nThese factors make Uptane a really good choice for many other kinds of software updates to embedded devices. Medical devices, industrial automation, robotics, and other fields can also benefit from using an Uptane system. The rule of thumb you should use is this: if end users will be making choices about the firmware on the device that go beyond choosing if/when to install the latest updates, you probably want \\"basic\\" TUF. If the devices should be controlled more centrally, with the manufacturer (or some other entity) choosing when software updates should be delivered, you should use Uptane.\\n\\n## What is Uptane?\\n\\nUptane is a standard, a set of rules to follow that will make your software update system resilient to a wide variety of real-world, long-term attacks. Uptane has various implementations, most of them proprietary, and many of them confidential and inside automotive companies. But to understand what it _is_, the best thing will be to show some diagrams.\\n\\nThis is a software repository, and a device that connects to it and installs an update. (I\'m going to just say \\"device\\" for the purposes of this article. It might be a vehicle, or a robot, or an MRI machine.)\\n\\n![](simple-repository.png)\\n\\nLet\'s say the repository is just an FTP server. It has some firmware images in it, in some kind of predictable directory structure. To make the repository more secure, you can follow the TUF standard. TUF describes how to add some signed metadata to a \\"normal\\" software repository like this, to make it possible for anyone who connects to the repository to verify a number of important properties related to timeliness, authenticity, and consistency. A TUF-compliant client can verify that:\\n\\n* The owner of the repository decided which packages to let in\\n* The publisher of each package signed their own software and uploaded it\\n* The versions of the packages I see here are actually the latest ones, or at least they\'re out of date by no more than some known amount of time\\n* The hash of every binary/firmware image on the repository can be independently checked and verified, in an automated way\\n* None of the keys used for signing software have been revoked\\n* ...and a number of other things; the overall threat model that TUF protects against is too large for a bullet-point list\\n\\nThis is great, and is enough for securing traditional package repositories, where the end user knows what to install--think PyPI, npm, apt, or Cargo. It also allows the publisher to remove packages from the repo, and prevent them from being installed. For example, if a version was discovered to have a serious bug, you can simply remove it from the repository to prevent people from installing it. (Compare this to signing each release package with, say, a GPG key that users store in their keyring: if you want prevent na\xefve users/clients from installing a particular version, you have to also revoke the key used to sign it, and try to make sure that the revocation is propagated. Not an easy task, which is why it\'s so rarely done.) Let\'s look at our picture now:\\n\\n![](tuf-repository.png)\\n\\nBut we need a bit more than this. Our clients are embedded devices or vehicles: we don\'t want to just give them a list of every possible package that exists and let them sort out what to install. We need to actually give them instructions about what to install, and we also need to know what\'s currently installed on them. This is where Uptane comes in. Uptane builds on TUF, adding a second entity called the Director repository. The Director repository is responsible for, well, _directing_ the devices to install the software they\'re supposed to have installed, via whatever internal business logic is required. It also processes and validates the manifests that the devices send, so it\'s a reliable source of truth for what software is currently installed. Again, I\'m not going to get into detail about how it does this; for now it\'s enough to know _what_ it does. \\n\\nSo, once you have a Director repository, an Image repository, and a device, the picture is complete. In broad strokes, the protocol for checking for an update goes like this:\\n\\n![](uptane-repository.png)\\n\\n\\nThat\'s more or less it. Of course, there are many, many details. The bulk of the standard relates to the exact procedures for how the device checks the metadata and signatures. And of course, we\'ve ignored the question of how software gets into a repository, how the signing keys are managed, and how Director decides what should be installed on the device. Uptane also deals with \\"secondaries,\\" meaning that one internet-connected microcontroller or embedded Linux device can download and validate firmware updates for other microcontrollers; you can read elsewhere about how secondaries work.\\n\\n### What Uptane Isn\'t\\n\\nIf you\'ve gotten to this point, you\'ve probably realized that there is a significant amount of stuff missing from the picture. Uptane doesn\'t say anything about:\\n\\n* an interface to manage the software in the repository\\n* how to keep track of the information Director gets from the devices\\n* how Director decides what software the device should have installed\\n* how the device actually installs the update\\n* how the device authenticates itself to the repository\\n* transport security between the repository and the device (though Uptane is resilient to transport security compromise)\\n\\nSo there\'s a lot of other stuff that you need to attach Uptane concepts to before you have a complete update system. Some of those things might be relatively easy, some harder, but there are certainly a lot of them.\\n\\nThe reason Uptane was created this way is that it was written to solve real problems with existing systems. TUF was created as a way for existing software repositories to improve their security; those repositories already had systems for developers to register their package names and upload their software, and clients that know how to install the packages. Uptane was created to be used by automakers who already have software repositories, suppliers sending them firmware, quality control processes for what constitutes a software release, aftersales and maintenance departments keeping track of what parts might need software updates, and so on. It\'s a standard that answers the question, \\"How can I make my existing, complex system safer?\\" It would also make the standard very bloated and very inflexible if we made arbitrary decisions about those auxiliary pieces; we want the Uptane Standard to remain focused on solving supply-chain security and software deployment security.\\n\\nBut what if you are coming at it from the opposite direction? You don\'t already have a big complex system to secure, and you just want to set up a software repository and deliver software updates to embedded devices, using best practices from the start? In short, now that you know what Uptane is and what Uptane isn\'t, how can you actually use it?\\n\\n## Ways to use Uptane Today\\n\\nSo, for a full Uptane system, you need:\\n\\n* An Image repository, with some APIs/interfaces for doing common things\\n* A Director repository, with some way to create software updates and assign them to devices\\n* A client on your device that can talk to your server, and install updates\\n\\nThere are actually pretty easy options for all of these things, including both free-as-in-beer and free-as-in-speech resources.\\n\\n### Servers/repositories\\n\\n* [OTA Community Edition](https://github.com/uptane/ota-community-edition/)\\n\\nOTA Community Edition is the open-source, community-maintained Uptane implementation. It implements an Image repository, Director repository, and a device registry to keep track of the manifests (and other information) the devices send. It has HTTP REST APIs for all of the basic necessities for Uptane, but also for the practical bits that you need, like actually assigning updates to devices, uploading software, generating keys, and so on.\\n\\nThe OTA Community Edition repository contains instructions for how to spin up the services on a local network; to run an adequate production instance you\'ll need to fill in some blanks. It doesn\'t currently have a well-maintained web UI, but it\'s still possible to use the UI that was previously developed and open-sourced by HERE Technologies, once you make a few modifications to stub out API calls to their proprietary services. (P.S.: If you\'re interested in contributing to Uptane, developing a community-maintained web UI for OTA Community Edition is one of the [projects we\'re proposing](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/gsoc/2024-gsoc-uptane) for [Google Summer of Code 2024](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)!)\\n\\n* [app.uptanedemo.org](http://app.uptanedemo.org)\\n\\nI\'ve spun up an instance of OTA Community Edition to help people get their feet wet, for free. It\'s open to the public as a demo instance, with all of its private signing keys published publicly (so, buyer beware: if you connect a device to this instance, anyone who wanted to could install malicious software). I wipe and reset it periodically. Some documentation on how to use it is coming soon, but for now, just pop into Discord and ask if you\'d like to connect a device to it.\\n\\n* [Torizon Cloud](https://www.torizon.io)\\n\\nTorizon Cloud is a service provided by Toradex, built around Uptane. You can make a limited-usage account for free; if you go beyond 10 devices you have to pay. Disclosure: I work for Toradex on the team that develops Torizon Cloud, so this is self-promotion. The service is primarily geared at people running Toradex\'s embedded Linux distro Torizon OS, but it is a perfectly normal Uptane server that you can use with any of the client options below.\\n\\n* Other commercial Uptane providers\\n\\nThere are other commercial providers of Uptane services, including Airbiquity\'s OTAMatic, HERE\'s OTA Connect, and CAROTA\'s Remote Updates. However, there don\'t appear to be open-source offerings of any of the parts, or demo servers that can be accessed without a commercial contract. (If anyone from those companies wants to reach out and correct me on that, I\'m happy to add a link.)\\n\\n### Clients\\n\\n* Build your own using [libaktualizr](https://github.com/uptane/aktualizr/)\\n\\nThe main way to get an Uptane client is to build one using [libaktualizr](https://github.com/uptane/aktualizr/). The aktualizr repository does include reference clients that can talk to OTA Community Edition servers. However, to really make use of Uptane and aktualizr, you\'ll want it to be integrated in your embedded Linux build.\\n\\n* Add aktualizr to your existing embedded Linux using [meta-updater](https://github.com/uptane/meta-updater/)\\n\\nMost people building embedded Linuxes these days use Yocto. You can use meta-updater to integrate aktualizr into your Yocto build. There will be some work to do if you want to use it with an unsupported board; in particular you\'ll need to integrate OSTree and your bootloader, to deploy the images.\\n\\n* Use [Torizon OS](https://www.torizon.io/) or [Common Torizon](https://github.com/commontorizon/Documentation)\\n\\nThis is probably the easiest way to get started. Torizon OS is a Linux distribution tailored for Toradex\'s embedded system-on-modules, so if you have Toradex hardware it\'s built right in. But even if you don\'t have a Toradex module, you can still use [Common Torizon](https://github.com/commontorizon/Documentation).

One of our community members, Jon Oster, has already put forth two compelling proposals, and we\'re eager to expand this list with your innovative ideas. Before diving into the details of Jon\'s proposals, let\'s encourage everyone to participate in the discussion and contribute fresh perspectives on our [GitHub discussion board](https://github.com/uptane/uptane.github.io/discussions/166).\\n\\nHere are the current projects proposed by Jon Oster:\\n\\n## Proposal 1: Integrating aktualizr with Popular Embedded Software Updaters \ud83d\udd04\\n\\nAktualizr, a Uptane client written in C++, focuses on embedded Linux systems. Uptane\'s core functionality is vital for securing and validating software updates in highly security-sensitive and safety-critical systems. However, aktualizr currently supports only OSTree as a method for installing updates.\\n\\nThis GSoC project aims to enhance aktualizr by implementing support for an A/B partition-based update method. Swupdate or RAUC, two popular open-source software updaters, are the targeted integration points. While libaktualizr already supports additional package managers, our ideal solution would be a collaboration with the maintainers of Swupdate or RAUC.\\n\\n**Key skills required:** Systems-level programming in C++\\n\\n**Potential mentors:** Jon Oster, Patti Vacek, Phil Wise, Rogerio Borin, Phil Lapczynski, Person-to-be-named-later from SWUpdate or RAUC project.\\n\\n## Proposal 2: Creating an Open-Source Web UI for OTA Community Edition  \ud83c\udf10\\n\\nUptane\'s project already boasts open-source implementations of core back-end services. However, setting up and using these services can be challenging. OTA Community Edition provides a simplified, Docker-based deployment method, but lacks a crucial component - a user-friendly UI.\\n\\nThis GSoC project seeks to develop a new, simplified UI from scratch and integrate it into OTA Community Edition. The goal is to enable ordinary users to interact with the system seamlessly. Additionally, the project should include a robust test suite to ensure the UI remains functional with any upstream changes in the core services.\\n\\n**Key skills required:** Front-end/UI development, automated testing, CI/CD\\n\\n**Potential mentors:** Jon Oster, Temi Adeyeri, [Mentor to be named]\\n\\n## Join the Discussion and Share Your Ideas \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\\n\\nIf you have any other amazing ideas to contribute, feel free to join the discussion on our [GitHub board](https://github.com/uptane/uptane.github.io/discussions/166). Remember, the deadline for submitting your ideas is January 22.

I\'m Abhijay Jain, and I\'m thrilled to share the incredible journey of my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project with Uptane. In this blog, I\'ll walk you through the key aspects of my project, the challenges faced, the milestones achieved, and the exciting future prospects for serving its community.\\n\\n## Student Info \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf93\\n\\nBefore we dive into the details, let me reintroduce myself:\\n\\n- **Name:** Abhijay Jain\\n- **Email:** Abhijay007j@gmail.com\\n- **GitHub Profile:** [https://github.com/Abhijay007](https://github.com/Abhijay007)\\n- **Medium:** [https://medium.com/@abhijay007j](https://medium.com/@abhijay007j)\\n- **LinkedIn:** [https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhijay-jain-551b01193/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhijay-jain-551b01193/)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcd9 Abstract\\n\\nUptane is an important project that provides secure software updates for connected vehicles, and it needs to offer a better experience to its users to encourage the adoption of the technology. The project\'s website is the primary source of information for users and developers, and it\'s essential that the information is easy to access and understand. The current website has a lot of information; however, it\'s not well-organized. It\'s difficult for new users to find the essential information they need. The navigation through the site is also challenging. All of these factors could discourage new users from learning more about the project. The goal of this project is to overhaul the Uptane.io website to create a better user experience through more logical organization and easier navigation.\\n\\n## :email: Communication during the development period\\n\\nBefore GSoC, contributors communicated with each other either through GitHub discussions or asynchronously via email. Since GSoC needed more regular discussion (more on a personal level), we decided to have bi-weekly meetings to have seamless communication and better understanding. For text conversations, we stuck to email as it is a feasible option for text-based communication. After every meeting, I used to write a follow-up email to the mentors so that we could have a backup or a routine outline of things we have discussed in those bi-weekly meetings.\\n\\n![Mail Screenshot](https://github.com/Abhijay007/Uptane-GSoC-Report/assets/64387054/e64e56ff-00e7-41c0-a3cb-77906596407a)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">One of our very first follow-up emails.</p>\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcdd About the project\\n\\nThe objective of this project is to deconstruct the current website layout and design and create a more logical arrangement of information. We aim to achieve this by:\\n\\n- Improving the existing platform and overall design of the website, including typeface and color choices, to create a cleaner, more contemporary look.\\n- Reorganizing the content to make it easier for users to find the information they need to consider before adopting or integrating the Uptane project.\\n- Identifying key information that may be missing and adding it to the website.\\n- Adding dynamic elements to the website to support more interactivity between users and the site.\\n\\n(PS: Here\u2019s [the link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lTvrFoS7VzOsNRWsmoHVOnTd0ui9BZ3g/view?usp=sharing) to my GSoC proposal if you\u2019re interested!)\\n\\n### Initialization \ud83d\ude80\\n\\nDuring our first meeting, we needed to make an important decision: whether to stick with the existing technology, which is Jekyll, or migrate the site to a new framework, Docusaurus. After a discussion, we decided to go with Docusaurus as it is quite easy to maintain and comparatively better than Jekyll. The mentors assigned me the task of testing the existing content of the site with Docusaurus so that we can determine if using this program would be feasible. So, I created a demo version of the site and shared it with the mentors. After review, both the mentors and other community members reviewed our decision to go with Docusaurus as our main framework to build the site. The mentors then suggested that I move forward and prepare a new design layout for the site.\\n\\n### New Site Layout\ud83d\udcd0\\n\\nI initiated the design of the new site by adopting a collaborative approach to receive continuous feedback. For efficient communication and design collaboration, I opted to use Figma, a tool with which I had prior experience. Figma served its purpose effectively. Lois shared a rough design doc [linked here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v4-tHH6dUWi-32H2qkBufHrZTsxzjHWGVHJGO9p0i34/edit?usp=sharing) explaining what we need on the new site, following which I started gathering design inspiration and shared a preliminary rough layout on Figma. I explored various platforms such as Dribbble and Behance. After conducting research, I stumbled upon a valuable resource: the Docusaurus showcase, which contained a collection of open-source sites built with Docusaurus. Drawing inspiration from these sites, I began working on the site\'s layout. I created a preliminary design that can be viewed below\\n\\n- Link to the Figma Design File : [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/drCXCmIbIiTq9yaSgQJQtF/uptane-New?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=3oGmlYrO4UafXxjz-1).\\n\\n| Figma Design Preview                                                                                                |\\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| <img src=\\"https://github.com/Abhijay007/Uptane-GSoC-Report/assets/64387054/dd785ad9-f432-4a61-b0c8-0ba3d617a17d\\" /> |\\n\\n- Here is a video overview of the site, where I explained all the sections\\n\\n<video controls width=\\"100%\\">\\n  <source src= \\"https://github.com/Abhijay007/Uptane-GSoC-Report/assets/64387054/0deb8aec-1c25-44e3-bf00-897f78c2a9f3\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n### Coding the Site \ud83d\udcbb\\n\\nOnce we had finalized the site\'s design to a significant extent, I embarked on the coding phase. Initially, I set up the existing site with Docusaurus boilerplate code to establish a starting point for development. Subsequently, I started coding individual components step by step, commencing with the home page and gradually extending to other sections. Throughout the development process, we engaged in iterative discussions and improvements to existing components. Some components that were initially included were reevaluated, and their significance was reconsidered, leading to a few additions and removals. Upon completion of the final layout, we proceeded with populating the site with documentation content and refining the existing codebase.\\n\\n### Content Improvements \ud83d\udcc4\\n\\nAfter completing the initial deployment and layout of the site, we shifted our focus to enhancing the content, which serves as the documentation for the Uptane community. In the existing site, we encountered several content-related issues. Firstly, there was an abundance of unnecessary content including a number of redundancies across the site, and secondly, some of the existing content was outdated and required substantial improvements.\\n\\nIn the new site, we undertook a comprehensive overhaul of the documentation structure and redefined the hierarchy. This restructuring presented us with some challenges, especially when dealing with content originally structured for the old Jekyll architecture. We needed to adapt this content to the Docusaurus-based Markdown format. Docusaurus treats Markdown files somewhat differently and provides helpful tools for managing content effectively.\\n\\nSome content on the site is fetched from different repositories. Initially, we contemplated establishing a workflow to handle this content, but over time, we realized that we could optimize the process by making edits to the existing workflows and ensuring that the updated content adheres to Docusaurus standards and best practices.\\n\\nFor details on the specific commits related to these content improvements, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/Abhijay007/uptane-demo/commits/master).\\n\\n## Important Links \ud83d\udd17\\n\\nFor those curious minds, here are essential links to explore:\\n\\n- [GSoC Project Page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/QDCxHcPz)\\n- [GSoC Project Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lTvrFoS7VzOsNRWsmoHVOnTd0ui9BZ3g/view?usp=sharing)\\n- [GitHub Organization Repo](https://github.com/uptane/uptane.github.io)\\n- [GitHub Personal Repo](https://github.com/Abhijay007/Abhijay007.github.io)\\n- [GitHub Project Demo Repo](https://github.com/Abhijay007/uptane-demo)\\n- [Commits during GSoC 2023](https://github.com/Abhijay007/uptane-demo/commits/master) in Demo Repo\\n- [Commits during GSoC 2023](https://github.com/uptane/uptane.github.io/commits?author=Abhijay007) in Main Repo - UptaneDocusaurus Branch\\n- [Website DEMO Deployed Version](https://abhijay007.github.io/uptane-demo/)\\n- [Website Live Deployed Version](https://uptane.github.io/)\\n\\n## Interactions with the Uptane Community \ud83e\udd1d\\n\\nI had the privilege of presenting myself and my GSoC project to the Uptane community at an Uptane workshop on June 23rd. During this presentation, I introduced myself and provided an overview of my GSoC project. Initially, I felt a bit nervous, and there were moments of hesitation during my presentation. However, the Uptane community and my mentors were incredibly supportive, and my efforts seemed to be appreciated.\\n\\nI received valuable assistance from Lois in preparing the initial presentation, and she also provided timely reviews, which greatly contributed to the success of my presentation.

Following the launch of our revamped website, a project that was part of the Google Summer of Code, we decided to participate in Hacktoberfest. This decision, suggested by one of our core website contributors, [Abhijay Jain](https://github.com/Abhijay007), marked a strategic step in leveraging our recent advancements, and further solidifying our presence in the open-source community. Our initial announcement about participating in Hacktoberfest can be found in our [previous blog post](https://uptane.org/blog/2023/10/28/hacktoberfest).\\n\\n## Participation in Hacktoberfest: Goals and Strategy\\nOur primary goal for participating in Hacktoberfest was twofold: to grow our vibrant open-source community and to address the lingering issues from our website\'s transition. With a new site comes new challenges, and we saw Hacktoberfest as an ideal platform to engage with skilled contributors who could help us refine and polish our online presence.\\n\\n## Community Engagement: Discord, GitHub, and Beyond\\nCommunity engagement was at the heart of our Hacktoberfest strategy. Our core community members played a crucial role in creating and managing issues, reviewing pull requests, and facilitating meaningful interactions with contributors. We leveraged Discord for real-time communication and discussions, while GitHub\'s robust communication tools were instrumental in managing our project workflows. This integrated approach allowed for efficient and effective collaboration, making the most of the talents and enthusiasm of the open-source community.\\n\\n## Contributions: Diverse and Impactful\\nDuring Hacktoberfest, Uptane received a variety of contributions that significantly enhanced our project. We were thrilled to see 14 pull requests, each addressing a separate issue. These ranged from simple textual improvements to our website to the setting up advanced Continuous Integration (CI) workflows and automations for our repository. This diversity in contributions reflects the breadth of skills and dedication within our community. A detailed list of the resolved issues can be found [here](https://github.com/uptane/uptane.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Ahacktoberfest).

This is the first blog of a GSoC series where I\'ll be sharing my entire journey as a contributor and student developer, from day zero to the project\'s completion. I\'m excited to have you join me on this adventure.\\n\\nBefore we delve into the details, let me first introduce myself, I\'m Abhijay Jain, a computer science student from India currently pursuing B-Tech. My specialization lies in front-end development and web-related technologies. I have a keen interest in open-source projects and have collaborated with various organizations, such as Fossaisa, JBoss, Layer5, Mexili, P5.js-sound, Script Foundation, Open Horizon, SCoRe Labs, and EtherealEngine. In the spring of 2022, I had the opportunity to contribute to Open Horizon as an LFX mentee, I worked as a GSoC\'22 student with SCoRe Lab, and currently, I\'m contributing to Ethereal Engine as an XROS fellow\'23, and now working with Uptane as a GSoC\'23 student.\\n\\nIn this blog post, I\'ll share how my GSoC journey started, including the application process and my experiences during the community bonding period. I\'ll also provide an overview of my activities during the first week of the coding phase. Let\'s get started!\\n\\nBut why am I documenting this journey?\\n\\nGood documentation is the key to effective collaboration. It provides a solid foundation for fostering innovation and driving progress. Not only does it serve as a valuable resource for reflection and learning, but it also helps us navigate through past experiences with clarity and relevance.\\n\\nSo let\'s talk about the selection progress and know little bit about GSoC as program as well.\\n\\n![intial image](image1.png)\\n\\n# Selection Process: How I got selected\\n\\nIn March, GSoC announced the open-source organizations participating in the program on their website. These organizations are seeking developer and provide project details. Interested individuals then submit detailed proposals outlining their project plans before the April deadline. Mentors from participating organizations evaluate the proposals, and the selected contributors are announced in May. After the selection process, the official coding period begins.\\n\\nMost of you are quite familiar with or heard about the overall selection process for Google Summer of Code. If you aren\'t, then don\'t worry, I will write a detailed post about the selection process in an upcoming blog.\\n\\nHaving been a GSoC student in the past, I was familiar with the process. However, this year, I wasn\'t sure if I would apply or not as I hadn\'t looked into projects extensively. I applied to [Uptane](https://github.com/uptane), a project I stumbled upon while reading about Linux Foundation projects. The project that caught my attention was called \\"Overhauling Uptane.io: Creating a Better User Experience for the Uptane Project Website.\\" It involved revamping the current Uptane site, adding new features, and improving its overall appearance.\\n\\nI applied to this project as I have previous experience with a similar tech stack and worked on documentation during my time in Open Horizon as an LFX mentee. I believe that this project could be impactful and provides an opportunity to create something that can be used as a resource by developers. If you want to read about the idealist in detail, you can refer to [here](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/gsoc/2023-gsoc-uptane).\\n\\nAlthough I applied a little late, my mentor [Lois Anne DeLong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lois-anne-delong-0706a128/) was incredibly supportive and helped me review my proposal. Despite the timing, I was fortunate enough to be selected for GSoC 2023 based on the quality of my proposal.\\n\\nBut before we delve into the details of my project, let\'s talk about the Uptane organization itself.\\n\\n![mid image](image2.png)\\n\\n# About Uptane: A short brief\\n\\nUptane is an open and secure software update framework designed to protect software delivered over-the-air to automobile electronic control units (ECUs). This framework provides protection against malicious actors who can compromise servers and networks used to sign and deliver updates. Uptane is integrated into Automotive Grade Linux, an open-source system used by many large OEMs, and has been adopted by several U.S. and international manufacturers.\\n\\nUptane was created in 2016 through a collaboration between NYU, UMTRI, SwRI, and automotive industry experts. It uses the basic design principles of TUF, which is used in many production software update systems.\\n\\nAccording to Wikipedia, \\"Uptane is a Linux Foundation / Joint Development Foundation hosted software framework designed to ensure that valid, current software updates are installed in adversarial environments. It establishes a process of checks and balances on these electronic control units (ECUs) to ensure the authenticity of incoming software updates. Uptane is designed for \'compromise-resilience,\' limiting the impact of a compromised repository, insider attacks, leaked signing keys, or similar attacks. It can be incorporated into most existing software update technologies, offering particular support for over-the-air programming or OTA programming strategies.\\"\\n\\nNow, let\'s get into a brief introduction to my GSoC\'23 project.\\n\\n# Brief Intro: Overhauling Uptane\\n\\nMy GSoC\'23 project involves enhancing the documentation website for Uptane. The main objective is to make the site more user-friendly, visually appealing, and accessible. By improving the documentation and the overall user experience, we aim to encourage wider adoption of Uptane and ensure a smooth onboarding process for developers and contributors.\\n\\nThe project\'s website serves as the primary source of information for users and developers, and it\'s essential that the information be easily accessible and understandable. However, the current website lacks organization and intuitive navigation, which could potentially discourage new users from adopting the system. Therefore, the goal of my project is to create a better user experience through improved organization and navigation.\\n\\nAfter carefully reading and understanding the project\'s requirements and proposed ideas, I prepared my proposal accordingly. The proposal covered the project objectives, goals, proposed ideas, deliverables, and more. It also explored alternate approaches, such as using different frameworks like Docusaurus, if necessary.\\n\\nIf you\'re interested in reading my full proposal in detail, you can find it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lTvrFoS7VzOsNRWsmoHVOnTd0ui9BZ3g/view?usp=sharing).\\n\\nOnce the selected contributors were announced in May, we entered the community bonding period, which allowed us to establish connections with our mentors and get familiar with the organization.\\n\\n# Community Bonding: Mentor Meeting & Task Breakdown Finalization\\n\\nAfter being selected for GSoC, the community bonding period began in May. This phase allows GSoC contributors to establish connections with their mentors and get familiar with the organization. During the community bonding period, I had the pleasure of connecting with my mentor, Lois, and other members of the Uptane community. Our initial call played a vital role in establishing a strong foundation for our collaboration. We discussed various important aspects, including:\\n\\n- Meeting Schedule: We established a regular meeting schedule that suited everyone involved. This ensured consistent communication throughout the project.\\n- Priorities: We identified key tasks that needed to becompleted and established their order of importance. This helped us prioritize our work and stay on track.\\n- Project Timeline: To ensure alignment with the GSoC review dates, we created a rough timeline that outlined the project\'s deadlines and milestones. This provided us with a clear roadmap to follow.\\n- Engaging the Uptane Community: We explored different ways to engage with the larger Uptane community, such as participating in online exchanges, contributing to blog posts, and more. This ensured that our work had a wider impact and fostered collaboration within the community.\\n\\nOne of the significant outcomes of our meeting was the decision to evaluate the use of Jekyll versus Docusaurus for revamping the site. After considering various factors and insights from mentors like Philip, Ira, Justin, and Andre, we concluded that Docusaurus would be the ideal choice. However, before fully committing to Docusaurus, we needed to ensure its compatibility with the existing Uptane documentation and address web accessibility concerns.\\n\\nWith our tasks and objectives defined, my mentor assigned me the initial task of creating a demo version of the site using Docusaurus. This basic version aimed to test the compatibility of the existing Uptane documentation with Docusaurus. I set up Docusaurus locally and migrated the Uptane docs to the new environment. Most of the markdown files seamlessly integrated with Docusaurus, requiring minimal adjustments. The demo version serves as a starting point for further enhancements.\\n\\nAfter a week of the community bonding period, the official coding phase began on May 29th.\\n\\n![last image](image3.png)\\n\\n# Week 1 Task: Coding Phase (from May 29th onwards) | Initializing the project\\n\\nDuring the first week of the coding phase, my primary task was to work on the demo version of the site. The goal was to determine if the existing Uptane docs are compatible with Docusaurus or if we should consider sticking with Jekyll, as discussed in our initial community call. I set up Docusaurus locally and migrated the Uptane docs to this new environment. The current state of the site is still quite basic, consisting of boilerplate code provided by Docusaurus along with the existing Uptane docs.\\n\\nFor creating the demo version of the site, I referred to the official [documentation of Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs).\\n\\nTo break down this task in simple words, I tested the existing markdown files present in the [current repo](https://github.com/uptane/uptane.github.io) with the boilerplate code of Docusaurus and made sure if it is compatible or not.\\n\\nWhile most of the markdown files integrated smoothly with Docusaurus, requiring minimal adjustments, there is still work to be done to enhance the overall functionality and design of the site.\\n\\nDocusaurus boilerplate code provides a project folder structure for managing docs, blogs, src file (like CSS or pages). It also contains a Docusaurus.config file which allows developers to configure Docusaurus according to their needs.\\n\\nIf you\'re curious to see the progress made so far and experience the demo version of the site, feel free to check it out [here](https://abhijay007.github.io/uptane-demo/). Keep in mind that the demo version may contain broken links or incomplete markdown files. To address this issue, we plan to implement a workflow that identifies broken links or orphan pages, ensuring that the documentation remains relevant and users encounter fewer 404 errors.\\n\\nI shared the demo version of the site with my mentors, along with the code repository (currently private). After careful consideration, we collectively decided to proceed with Docusaurus as it offers ease of maintenance, utilizes the latest technologies, and provides a more accessible and user-friendly experience. Moreover, Docusaurus allows us to build an ecosystem by integrating various modern tools, which would be challenging with Jekyll.\\n\\n# What\'s Next?\\n\\nDuring our second community call, we discussed the tasks for the second week. In our call, we focused specifically on the design aspect of the site after the demo version. I suggested that all mentors visit the [Docusaurus Showcase website](https://docusaurus.io/showcase) to gather inspiration from existing sites regarding navigation, hero sections, footers, and other content. By sharing your valuable suggestions, we can collectively create compelling designs. Our goal is to achieve an attractive landing page before the first evaluation to make our site more presentable and engaging.\\n\\nOne of the mentors, Jon, shared crucial points regarding getting Docusaurus working with a multi-instance build. He mentioned that the deployment considerations are present in a separate repository. It would be great if we could directly fetch the deployment considerations from that repository and set up CI/CD pipelines for both deployment and pull requests.\\n\\nTo summarize the tasks for the upcoming weeks:\\n\\n- Create a compelling design incorporating mentor feedback.\\n- Find a way to make Docusaurus work with a multi-instance build and set up CI/CD pipelines accordingly.\\n\\nIn addition to these tasks, we have an Uptane workshop scheduled for June 23. As a GSoC contributor, I am grateful for the opportunity to present my GSoC project in front of the Uptane community. During this presentation, I will provide an overview of the project, discuss what we aim to achieve, and share the progress made up until the workshop.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, the journey of GSoC\'23 has begun, and I\'m thrilled to share my experiences as a contributor and student developer with all of you. This blog marks the beginning of a series where I\'ll be documenting my entire journey, from day zero to the completion of the Uptane documentation website project.\\n\\nStay tuned for the upcoming blog posts, where I\'ll be sharing more about the development process, milestones, challenges faced, and the exciting enhancements we make to the Uptane documentation website.\\n\\nThank you for joining me on this incredible journey, and I look forward to sharing more updates with you soon!"}]}}')}}]);
