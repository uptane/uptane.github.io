Uptane is an open and secure software update system design which 
protects software delivered over-the-air to the computerized units of 
automobiles.  The framework can thwart attacks from malicious actors who can
compromise servers and networks used to sign and deliver updates.  Hence, it is designed to be resilient even to the best efforts of nation state
attackers. There are multiple different free open source and closed source
implementations available.  Uptane is integrated into [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/),
an open source system currently used by many large OEMs, and has also been adopted by a number of U.S. and international manufacturers. Within the next few years, about one-third of new cars on U.S. roads will include Uptane.

Currently considered the *de facto* secure standard for software updates on
automobiles, in July 2018 formal standardization of Uptane began under a non-profit consortium called the [Uptane
Alliance](https://ieee-isto.org/member_programs/uptane-alliance/). [Uptane Standard for Design and Implementation](https://uptane.github.io/uptane-standard/uptane-standard.html) Volume 1.0, which presents procedures for the secure design and implementation of the framework, was released on July 31, 2019 under the auspices of the [IEEE/ISTO Federation](https://ieee-isto.org/). Subsequent versions of the Standard, along with other relevant guidelines for deployment and testing Uptane, will be released through Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC, Uptane Series, an initiative of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). Standardization
will encourage adoption and ensure clear guidance for future
users. 

The Uptane Standard document can be accessed free of charge. Recommended deployment strategies are also currently being prepared and will be posted on this web site upon completion. All Uptane materials, including [technical papers](https://uptane.github.io/publications.html),
[security audits](https://uptane.github.io/audits.html), and
[a public reference implementation](https://github.com/uptane/uptane)
are also available to all without a fee, as is guidance for preparing and using Uptane [POUFs](https://uptane.github.io/pouf.html), a mechanism to describe the Protocols, Operations, Usage, and Formats needed to ensure interoperability of Uptane implementations.
