<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="abstract">Abstract<a href="#abstract" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Abstract" title="Direct link to Abstract">​</a></h2>
<p>This document describes a framework for securing ground vehicle software update systems.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-introduction">1. Introduction<a href="#1-introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Introduction" title="Direct link to 1. Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>Uptane is a secure software update framework for ground vehicles. This document describes procedures to enable programmers for OEMs and suppliers to securely design and implement this framework in a manner that better protects connected units on ground vehicles. Integrating Uptane as outlined in the sections that follow can reduce the ability of attackers to compromise critical systems. It also assures a faster and easier recovery process when a compromise occurs.</p>
<p>These instructions delineate the set of requirements necessary for specific ECU implementations to satisfy all conformance stipulations of the Uptane Standard. ISO/IEC 13210:1999 Information Technology, as cited in the <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO Online Browsing Platform</a> defines a “conformance requirement” as “a requirement stated in a <em>base standard</em> that identifies a specific requirement in a finite, measurable, and unambiguous manner. A <em>conformance requirement</em> by itself or in conjunction with other conformance requirements corresponds to an <em>assertion.</em>” Individual implementers can make their own technological choices within those requirements. This flexibility makes Uptane adaptable to the many customized update solutions used by manufacturers. If implementers wish to have compatible formats, they can use POUFs. POUFs contain a description of implementation choices as well as data binding formats. An implementer who adopts a POUF, as well as the Uptane Standard, will be able to interoperate with other implementations using that POUF.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Conformance terminology and Uptane role terminology presented below, please refer to the <a href="https://uptane.github.io/deployment-considerations/glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glossary</a> in the Deployment Best Practices volume for definitions of all terms used in this Standard.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="21-conformance-terminology">2.1. Conformance terminology<a href="#21-conformance-terminology" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.1. Conformance terminology" title="Direct link to 2.1. Conformance terminology">​</a></h2>
<p>The keywords REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="#rfc2119">[RFC2119]</a>. Given the importance of interpreting these terms correctly, we present these definitions here. Note that when referring to actions in the Standard that mandate conformance, the word SHALL will be used, rather than the word MUST.</p>
<p><em>SHALL</em> This word or the term “REQUIRED” mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification. <em>SHALL NOT</em> This phrase means that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification. <em>SHOULD</em> This word or the adjective “RECOMMENDED” mean that, in particular circumstances, there could exist valid reasons to ignore a particular item, but the full implications will be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course. <em>SHOULD NOT</em> This phrase or the phrase “NOT RECOMMENDED” mean that there could exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications will be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. <em>MAY</em> This word or the adjective “OPTIONAL,” mean that an item is truly optional.</p>
<p>In order to be considered conformant to the Uptane Standard, an implementation SHALL follow all of these rules as specified in the document.</p>
<p>Note that, following the recommendations of <a href="#rfc2119">[RFC2119]</a>, imperatives of the type defined here will be used only when essential for security.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="22-uptane-role-terminology">2.2. Uptane role terminology<a href="#22-uptane-role-terminology" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.2. Uptane role terminology" title="Direct link to 2.2. Uptane role terminology">​</a></h2>
<p>These terms are defined in greater detail in <a href="#51-roles-on-repositories">Section 5.1</a>.</p>
<p><em>Delegation</em>: A process by which the responsibility of signing metadata about images is assigned to another party.</p>
<p><em>Role</em>: A party (human or machine) responsible for signing a certain type of metadata. The role controls keys and is responsible for signing the metadata entrusted to it with these keys. The roles mechanism of Uptane allows the system to distribute signing responsibilities so that the compromise of one key does not necessarily impact the security of the entire system.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Root role</em>: Signs metadata that distributes and revokes public keys used to verify the Root, Timestamp, Snapshot, and Targets role metadata.</li>
<li><em>Snapshot role</em>: Signs metadata that indicates which images the repository has released at the same time.</li>
<li><em>Targets role</em>: Signs metadata used to verify the image, such as cryptographic hashes and file size.</li>
<li><em>Timestamp role</em>: Signs metadata that indicates if there are any new metadata or images on the repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>This Standard document provides the essential components for the secure design, implementation, and deployment of Uptane by OEMs and suppliers. These guidelines contribute to compromise resilience, or the ability to minimize the extent of the threat posed by any given attack.</p>
<p>However, this specification is intended as an implementation guide, and not as a detailed technical argument about the security properties that Uptane provides. Readers interested in such documentation can refer to published papers that cover this topic. <a href="#uptaneescar">[UPTANEESCAR]</a></p>

Why Uptane requires a standards document" title="Direct link to 3.1. Why Uptane requires a standards document">​</a></h2>
<p>A standards document that can guide the safe design, integration, and deployment of Uptane in vehicles is needed at this time because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of connected units on the average vehicle continues to grow, with mainstream cars now containing up to 100 million lines of code. <a href="#usatoday">[USATODAY]</a></li>
<li>The expanded use of software over-the-air strategies creates new attack surfaces for malicious parties. <a href="#cr-ota">[CR-OTA]</a></li>
<li>Legacy update strategies, such as SSL/TLS or GPG/RSA, are not feasible for use on vehicle ECUs because they force manufacturers to chose between enhanced security and customizability.</li>
<li>Conventional strategies are also complicated by the differing resources of the ECUs, which can vary greatly in memory, storage space, and Internet connectivity.</li>
<li>The design of Uptane makes it possible to offer improved design flexibility without sacrificing security.</li>
<li>This added design flexibility, however, could be a liability if the framework is implemented incorrectly.</li>
<li>Standardization of crucial steps in the design, implementation, and use of Uptane can assure that customizability does not impact security or functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>This document sets guidelines for implementing Uptane in most systems capable of updating software on connected units in ground vehicles, including passenger vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks, and motorcycles. Uptane could potentially also be applied to other ground vehicles, such as automated shuttles, recreational vehicles, and military ground vehicles. Uptane could even be applied to domains such as IoT devices, medical devices, and autonomous aerial vehicles. In this section, we define the scope of that applicability by providing sample use cases and possible exceptions, aspects of software update security that are not applicable to Uptane, and the design requirements governing the preparation of these standards.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="321-assumptions">3.2.1. Assumptions<a href="#321-assumptions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.2.1. Assumptions" title="Direct link to 3.2.1. Assumptions">​</a></h2>
<p>We assume the following system preconditions for Uptane:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vehicles have the ability to establish connectivity to required backend services. For example, this could be done through cellular, Wi-Fi, or hard-wired mechanisms.</li>
<li>ECUs are either directly connected to the communication channel, or are indirectly connected via some sort of network gateway.</li>
<li>ECUs are programmable and provide sufficient performance to be updated.</li>
<li>ECUs SHALL be able to perform public key cryptography operations and calculate hashes of images and metadata files.</li>
<li>There are state-of-the-art secure servers in place, such as the Director and Image repository servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important that any bugs detected in Uptane implementations be patched promptly. Failure to do so could interfere with the effectiveness of Uptane’s operations.</p>

<p>The following use cases provide a number of scenarios illustrating the manner in which software updates could be accomplished using Uptane.</p>

<p>An OEM plans to install Uptane on new vehicles. This entails the following components: code to perform full and partial verification, the latest copy of the relevant metadata, the public keys, and an accurate attestation of the latest time. The OEM then either requires its tier-1 suppliers to provide these materials to the suppliers’ assembly lines or can choose to add the materials later at the OEM’s assembly lines. The OEM’s in-vehicle implementation is Uptane-conformant if:</p>
<ol>
<li>all Primaries perform full verification;</li>
<li>all Secondaries that are updated via OTA at least perform partial verification; and</li>
<li>any ECUs that do not perform any type of verification cannot be updated via OTA.</li>
</ol>

<p>A tier-1 supplier completes work on a revised image for an electronic brake control module. This module will control the brakes on all models of an SUV produced by the OEM mentioned above. Assuming supplier delegation is supported by the OEM for this ECU, each tier-1 supplier digitally signs the image, then delivers the signature, all of its metadata, including delegations, and associated images to the OEM. The OEM adds these metadata and images to its Image repository, along with information about any dependencies and conflicts between this image and those for other ECUs used in the OEM’s vehicles. The OEM also updates the inventory database, so that the Director repository can instruct the ECU on how to install these updated images.</p>

<p>An OEM has issued a recall to address a problem with a keyless entry device that has been locking people out of their cars. The OEM prepares an updated flash image in the manner described above. The OEM then ships USB flash drives to vehicle owners and dealerships that allow those parties to update the firmware of their vehicles.</p>

<p>The OEM wants to use delta updates to save over-the-air bytes. The delta images contain only the code and/or data that has changed from the previous image version. To do so, the OEM will first modify the Director repository, using the vehicle version manifest and dependency resolution to determine the differences between the previous and latest images. The OEM will then add the following to the custom Targets metadata used by the Director repository: (1) the algorithm used to apply a delta image, and (2) the Targets metadata about the delta image. The OEM will also check whether the delta images match the Targets metadata from the Director repository.</p>

<p>There are a number of factors that could impede the completion of the above scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>ECUs can be lacking the necessary resources to function as designated. These insufficient resources could include limited CPU or RAM inadequate for performance of public key cryptography; a lack of sufficient storage to undo installation of bad software; or a location on a low-speed network (e.g., LIN).</li>
<li>ECUs can reside on different network segments, and cannot directly reach each other, requiring a gateway to facilitate communication.</li>
<li>A user can replace OEM-installed ECUs with aftermarket ECUs.</li>
<li>A vehicle can download only a limited amount of data via a cellular channel (e.g. due to limits on a data plan).</li>
<li>A system can lack sufficient power to download or install software updates.</li>
<li>Vehicles can be offline for extended periods of time, thus missing required updates (e.g., key rotations).</li>
<li>OEMs can be unwilling to implement costly security or hardware requirements.</li>

<p>The following topics will not be addressed in this document, as they represent threats outside the scope of Uptane:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical attacks, such as manual tampering with ECUs outside the vehicle.</li>
<li>Compromise of the packaged software, such as malware embedded in a trusted package.</li>
<li>Compromise of the supply chain (e.g., build system, version control system, packaging process). The focus of Uptane is end device security and secure delivery. It addresses one part of the solution, but it is designed to pair well with more holistic solutions, like in-toto <a href="#in-toto">[IN-TOTO]</a>, git signing, TPMs, etc. Recently, the Uptane community approved <a href="https://github.com/uptane/pures/blob/main/pure3.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scudo</a> as an Uptane augmentation that could be adopted as a formal recommendation in the Uptane Deployment Best Practices in the future.</li>
<li>Problems associated with OBD or UDS programming of ECUs, such as authentication of communications between ECUs.</li>
<li>Malicious mirrors of package repositories, which could substitute original packages with malicious packages with matching version numbers <a href="#mercury">[MERCURY]</a>.</li>

<p>The design requirements for this document are governed by the following principal parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>to clearly mandate the design and implementation steps that are security critical and will be followed as is, while offering flexibility in the implementation of non-critical steps. In this manner, users can adapt to support different use models and deployment scenarios.</li>
<li>to ensure that, if Uptane is implemented, the security practices mandated or suggested in this document do not interfere with the functionality of ECUs, vehicles, or the systems that maintain them.</li>
<li>to delineate guidelines to ensure that, when any part of the SOTA mechanism of a vehicle is attacked, an attacker has to compromise two or more modules to breach the SOTA mechanism.</li>

Threat model and attack strategies">​</a></h2>
<p>The overarching goal of Uptane is to provide a system that is resilient in the face of various types of compromise. In this section, we describe the goals an attacker could have (<a href="#41-attacker-goals">Section 4.1</a>) and the capabilities they could have or could develop (<a href="#42-attacker-capabilities">Section 4.2</a>). We then describe and classify types of attacks on the system according to the attacker’s goals (<a href="#43-description-of-threats">Section 4.3</a>).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="41-attacker-goals">4.1. Attacker goals<a href="#41-attacker-goals" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4.1. Attacker goals" title="Direct link to 4.1. Attacker goals">​</a></h2>
<p>We assume that attackers could want to achieve one or more of the following goals, in increasing order of severity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the contents of updates to discover confidential information, reverse-engineer firmware, or compare two firmware images to identify security fixes and hence determine the fixed security vulnerability.</li>
<li>Deny installation of updates to prevent vehicles from fixing software problems.</li>
<li>Cause one or more ECUs in the vehicle to fail, denying use of the vehicle or of certain functions.</li>
<li>Control ECUs within the vehicle, and possibly the vehicle itself.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="42-attacker-capabilities">4.2. Attacker capabilities<a href="#42-attacker-capabilities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4.2. Attacker capabilities" title="Direct link to 4.2. Attacker capabilities">​</a></h2>
<p>Uptane is designed with resilience to compromise in mind. We assume that attackers could develop one or more of the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intercept and modify network traffic (i.e., perform man-in-the-middle attacks). This capability could be developed in two domains:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Outside the vehicle, intercepting and modifying traffic between the vehicle and software repositories.</li>
<li>Inside the vehicle, intercepting and modifying traffic on one or more vehicle buses (e.g., via an OBD port or by using a compromised ECU as a vector).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compromise and control either a Director repository or Image repository server, and any keys stored on that repository, but not both the Director and Image repositories.</li>
<li>Compromise either a Primary ECU or a Secondary ECU, but not both in the same vehicle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Uptane’s threat model includes the following types of attacks, organized according to the attacker goals listed in <a href="#41-attacker-goals">Section 4.1</a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="431-read-updates">4.3.1. Read updates<a href="#431-read-updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4.3.1. Read updates" title="Direct link to 4.3.1. Read updates">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Eavesdrop attack:</em> Read sensitive or confidential information from an update intended to be encrypted for a specific ECU. (Note: Not all implementations will have a need to protect information in this way.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="432-deny-installation-of-updates">4.3.2.

Deny installation of updates">​</a></h2>
<p>An attacker seeking to deny the installation of updates could attempt one or more of the following strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Drop-request attack:</em> Block network traffic outside or inside the vehicle.</li>
<li><em>Slow retrieval attack:</em> Slow down network traffic, in the extreme case sending barely enough packets to avoid a timeout. Similar to a drop-request attack, except that both the sender and receiver of the traffic still think network traffic is unimpeded.</li>
<li><em>Freeze attack:</em> Continue to send a properly signed, but old, update bundle to the ECUs, even if newer updates exist.</li>
<li><em>Partial bundle installation attack:</em> Install a valid (signed) update bundle, and then block selected updates within the bundle.</li>
<li><em>Denial of service attack</em> against the Uptane repositories or infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

Interfere with ECU functionality">​</a></h2>
<p>Attackers seeking to interfere with the functionality of vehicle ECUs in order to cause an operational failure or unexpected behavior could do so in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Rollback attack:</em> Cause an ECU to install a previously valid software revision that is older than the currently installed version.</li>
<li><em>Endless data attack:</em> Send a large amount of data to an ECU until it runs out of storage, possibly causing the ECU to fail to operate.</li>
<li><em>Mix-and-match attack:</em> Install a malicious software bundle in which some of the updates do not interoperate properly. This could be accomplished even if all of the individual images being installed are valid, as long as valid versions exist that are mutually incompatible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Full control of a vehicle, or one or more ECUs within a vehicle, is the most severe threat.</p>

<p>Uptane does not specify implementation details. Instead, this Standard describes the components necessary for a conformant implementation and leaves it up to individual implementers to make their own technology choices within those requirements.</p>
<p>At a high level, Uptane requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two software repositories:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>An Image repository containing binary images to install and signed metadata about those images.</li>
<li>A Director repository connected to an inventory database that can sign metadata on demand for images in the Image repository.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repository tools for generating Uptane-specific metadata about images.</li>
<li>A public key infrastructure supporting the required metadata production and signing roles on each repository:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Root - The certificate authority for the Uptane ecosystem. Distributes public keys for verifying all the other roles’ metadata.</li>
<li>Timestamp - Indicates whether there are new metadata or images.</li>
<li>Snapshot - Indicates images released by the repository at a point in time via signing metadata about Targets metadata.</li>
<li>Targets - Indicates metadata about images, such as hashes and file sizes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A secure way for ECUs to know the time.</li>
<li>An ECU capable of downloading images and associated metadata from the Uptane servers.</li>
<li>An in-vehicle client on a Primary ECU capable of verifying the signatures on all update metadata and downloading updates on behalf of its associated Secondary ECUs. The Primary ECU can be the same ECU that communicates with the server.</li>
<li>A client or library on each Secondary ECU capable of performing either full or partial verification of metadata.</li>
</ul>

<p>A repository contains images and metadata. Each role has a particular type of metadata associated with it, as described in <a href="#52-metadata-structures">Section 5.2</a>.</p>

<p>A repository’s Root role SHALL produce and sign Root metadata as described in <a href="#522-root-metadata">Section 5.2.2</a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="512-the-targets-role">5.1.2. The Targets role<a href="#512-the-targets-role" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5.1.2. The Targets role" title="Direct link to 5.1.2. The Targets role">​</a></h2>
<p>A repository’s Targets role SHALL produce and sign metadata about images and delegations as described in <a href="#523-targets-metadata">Section 5.2.3</a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5121-delegations">5.1.2.1. Delegations<a href="#5121-delegations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5.1.2.1. Delegations" title="Direct link to 5.1.2.1. Delegations">​</a></h2>
<p>The Targets role on the Image repository can delegate the responsibility of signing metadata to other, custom-defined roles referred to as delegated targets. If it does, it SHALL do so as specified in <a href="#5232-metadata-about-delegations">Section 5.2.3.2</a>.</p>
<p>As responsibility for signing images or a subset of images could be delegated to more than one role, it is possible that two different roles will be trusted to sign a particular image. For this reason, delegations SHALL be prioritized.</p>
<p>A particular delegation for a subset of images could be designated as <strong>terminating</strong>. For terminating delegations, the client SHALL NOT search any further if it does not find validly signed metadata about those images. Delegations SHOULD NOT be terminating by default; terminating delegations SHOULD only be used when there is a compelling technical reason to do so.</p>
<p>A delegation for a subset of images could be a multi-role delegation <a href="#tap-3">[TAP-3]</a>. A multi-role delegation indicates that multiple roles are needed to sign a particular image and each of the delegatee roles SHALL sign the same metadata.</p>
<p>Delegations only apply to the Image repository. The Targets role on the Director repository SHALL NOT delegate metadata signing responsibility.</p>

<p>A repository’s Snapshot role SHALL produce and sign metadata about all Targets metadata the repository releases, including the current version number of the top-level Targets metadata, and the version numbers of all delegated Targets metadata, as described in <a href="#524-snapshot-metadata">Section 5.2.4</a>.</p>

<p>A repository’s Timestamp role SHALL produce and sign metadata indicating whether there are new metadata or images on the repository. It SHALL do so by signing the metadata about the Snapshot metadata file.</p>

<p>Uptane’s security guarantees all rely on properly created metadata that follows a designated structure. The Uptane Standard <strong>does not</strong> mandate any particular format or encoding for the metadata as a whole. ASN.1 (with any encoding scheme like BER, DER, XER, etc.), JSON, XML, or any other encoding format that is capable of providing the required structure can be used.</p>
<p>However, string comparison is required as part of metadata verification. To ensure an accurate basis for comparing strings, all strings SHALL be encoded in the Unicode Format for Network Interchange as defined in <a href="#rfc5198">[RFC5198]</a>, including normalization into Unicode Normalization Form C (<a href="#nfc">[NFC]</a>).</p>
<p>The <em>Deployment Best Practices</em> (<a href="#deploy">[DEPLOY]</a>), Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC, Uptane Series provides some examples of metadata structures in ASN.1 and JSON that conform to the Standard.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="521-common-metadata-structures">5.2.1.

<p>Every public key SHALL be represented using a public key identifier. A public key identifier is EITHER all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of the public key itself (which could be, for example, formatted as a PEM string)</li>
<li>The public key cryptographic algorithm used by the key (such as RSA or ECDSA)</li>
<li>The particular scheme used to verify the signature (such as rsassa-pss-sha256 or ecdsa-sha2-nistp256)</li>
</ul>
<p>OR a secure hash over at least the above components (such as the keyid mechanism in TUF).</p>
<p>All four Uptane roles (Root, Targets, Snapshot, and Timestamp) share a common structure. They SHALL contain the following two attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A payload of metadata to be signed</li>
<li>An attribute containing the signature(s) of the payload, where each entry specifies:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The public key identifier of the key being used to sign the payload</li>
<li>A signature with this key over the payload</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The payload differs depending on the role. However, the payload for all roles shares a common structure. It SHALL contain the following four attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An indicator of the type of role (Root, Targets, Snapshot, or Timestamp)</li>
<li>An expiration date and time</li>
<li>An integer version number, which SHOULD be incremented each time the metadata file is updated</li>
<li>The role-specific metadata for the role indicated</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections describe the role-specific metadata. All roles SHALL follow the common structures described here.</p>

<p>A repository’s Root metadata distributes the public keys of the top-level Root, Targets, Snapshot, and Timestamp roles, as well as revocations of those keys. It SHALL contain two attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A representation of the public keys for all four roles. Each key SHALL have a unique public key identifier.</li>
<li>An attribute mapping each role to (1) its public key(s), and (2) the threshold of signatures required for that role.</li>

<p>The Targets metadata on a repository contains all of the information about images to be installed on ECUs. This includes filenames, hashes, and file sizes. It can also include other useful information, such as what types of hardware are compatible with a particular image.</p>
<p>Targets metadata can also contain metadata about delegations, allowing one Targets role to delegate its authority to another. This means that an individual Targets metadata file might contain only metadata about delegations, only metadata about images, or some combination of the two. The details of how ECUs traverse the delegation tree to find valid metadata about images is specified in <a href="#5447-how-to-resolve-delegations">Section 5.4.4.7</a>.</p>

<p>To be available to install on clients, all images on the repository SHALL have their metadata listed in a Targets role. Each Targets role can provide a list of some images on the repository. This list SHALL provide, at a minimum, the following information about each image:</p>
<ul>
<li>The image filename</li>
<li>The size of the image in bytes</li>
<li>One or more hashes of the image file, along with the hashing function used</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are no images included in the Targets metadata from the Director repository, then the metadata SHALL include a vehicle identifier in order to avoid a replay attack.</p>

<p>In addition to what is required, Targets metadata files can contain extra metadata for images on the repository. This metadata can be customized for a particular use case. Examples of use cases for different types of custom metadata can be found in the <em>Deployment Best Practices</em> document (<a href="#deploy">[DEPLOY]</a>). However, there are a few important pieces of custom metadata that SHOULD be present in most implementations. In addition, there is one element in the custom metadata that SHALL be present in the Targets metadata from the Director.</p>
<p>Custom metadata can also contain a demarcated field or section that SHALL match whenever two pieces of metadata are checked against each other, such as when Targets metadata from the Director repository is checked against Targets metadata from the Image repository.</p>
<p>The information listed below SHOULD be provided for each image on both the Image repository and the Director repository. If a “SHALL match section” is to be implemented, that is where this information SHOULD be placed.</p>
<ul>
<li>A release counter, to be incremented each time a new version of the image is released. This can be used to prevent rollback attacks even in cases where the Director repository is compromised.</li>
<li>A hardware identifier, or list of hardware identifiers, representing models of ECUs with which the image is compatible. This can be used to ensure that an ECU cannot be ordered to install an incompatible image, even in cases where the Director repository is compromised.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following information is CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED for each image on the Director repository IF that image is encrypted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about filenames, hashes, and file size of the encrypted image.</li>
<li>Information about the encryption method, and other relevant information–for example, a symmetric encryption key encrypted by the ECU’s asymmetric key could be included in the Director repository metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following information SHALL be provided from the Director repository for each image in the Targets metadata:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ECU identifier (such as a serial number), specifying the ECU that SHOULD install the image.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Director repository could provide a download URL for the image file. This may be useful, for example, when the image is on a public CDN and the Director wishes to provide a signed URL.</p>

<p>A Targets metadata file on the Image repository (but not the Director repository) SHALL be able to delegate signing authority to other entities. For example, it could delegate signing authority for a particular ECU’s firmware to that ECU’s supplier. A metadata file can contain any number of delegations and SHALL keep the delegations in prioritized order.</p>
<p>Any metadata file with delegations SHALL provide the following information:</p>

Repository mapping metadata">​</a></h2>
<p>As described in the introduction to <a href="#5-detailed-design-of-uptane">Section 5</a>, Uptane requires a Director repository and an Image repository. However, it is possible to have an Uptane-conformant implementation that has more than two repositories.</p>
<p>Repository mapping metadata informs a Primary ECU about which repositories to trust for images or image paths. <a href="#tap-4">[TAP-4]</a> describes how to make use of more complex repository mapping metadata in order to have more than the two required repositories.</p>
<p>Repository mapping metadata, or the equivalent informational content, SHALL be present on all Primary ECUs, and SHALL contain the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of repository names and one or more URLs at which the named repository can be accessed. At a minimum, this SHALL include the Director and Image repositories.</li>
<li>A list of mappings of image paths to repositories, each of which contains:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>A list of image paths. Image paths could be expressed using wildcards, or by enumerating a list, or a combination of the two.</li>
<li>A list of repositories that SHALL provide signed Targets metadata for images stored at those paths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in the most basic Uptane case, the repository mapping metadata would contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name and URL of the Director repository.</li>
<li>The name and URL of the Image repository.</li>
<li>A single mapping indicating that all images (*) SHALL be signed by both the Director and Image repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the metadata need not be in the form of a metadata file. For example, in the basic case where there is only one Director and one Image repository, and all images need to have signed metadata from both repositories, it would be sufficient to have a configuration file with URLs for the two repositories and a client that always checks for metadata matches between them. In this case, no explicit mapping would be defined, because the mapping is defined as part of the Uptane client implementation.</p>
<p>The <em>Uptane Deployment Best Practices</em> document (<a href="#deploy">[DEPLOY]</a>) provides more guidance on how to implement repository mapping metadata for more complex use cases. It also discusses strategies for updating repository mapping metadata, if required.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="527-rules-for-filenames-in-repositories-and-metadata">5.2.7. Rules for filenames in repositories and metadata<a href="#527-rules-for-filenames-in-repositories-and-metadata" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5.2.7. Rules for filenames in repositories and metadata" title="Direct link to 5.2.7. Rules for filenames in repositories and metadata">​</a></h2>
<p>There is a difference between the filename in a metadata file or an ECU, and the filename on a repository. This difference exists in order to avoid race conditions, where metadata and images are read from, and written to, at the same time. For more details, the reader can read the TUF specification <a href="#tuf-spec">[TUF-spec]</a> and PEP 458 <a href="#pep-458">[PEP-458]</a>.</p>
<p>Unless stated otherwise, all files SHALL be written to repositories in accordance with the following two rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Metadata filenames SHALL be qualified with version numbers. If a metadata file A is specified as FILENAME.EXT in another metadata file B, then it SHALL be written as VERSION.FILENAME.EXT, where VERSION is A’s version number, as defined in <a href="#521-common-metadata-structures">Section 5.2.1</a>, with one exception: If the version number of the Timestamp metadata file is not be known in advance by a client, it could be read from, and written to, a repository using a filename without a version number qualification, i.e., FILENAME.EXT.</li>
<li>If an image is specified in a Targets metadata file as FILENAME.EXT, it SHALL be written to the repository as HASH.FILENAME.EXT, where HASH is one of the hash digests of the file, as specified in <a href="#5231-metadata-about-images">Section 5.2.3.1</a>. The file SHALL be written to the repository using <em>n</em> different filenames, one for each hash digest listed in its corresponding Targets metadata.</li>
<li>Filenames of images SHOULD be encoded to prevent a path traversal on the client system, either by using URL encoding or by limiting the allowed character set in the filename.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The version number of the Snapshot metadata file is 61, and its filename in the Timestamp metadata is <em>snapshot.json</em>. The filename on the repository will be <em>61.snapshot.json</em>.</li>
<li>There is an image with the <em>filename acme_firmware.bin</em> specified in the Targets metadata, with a SHA3-256 of <em>aaaa</em> and a SHA-512/224 of <em>bbbb</em>. It will have two filenames on the repository: <em>aaaa.acme_firmware.bin</em> and <em>bbbb.acme_firmware.bin</em>.</li>

<p>An Uptane implementation SHALL make the following services available to vehicles:</p>

<p>The Image repository exists to allow an OEM and/or its suppliers to upload images and their associated metadata. It makes these images and their metadata available to vehicles. The Image repository is designed to be primarily controlled by human actors, and updated relatively infrequently.</p>
<p>The Image repository SHALL expose an interface permitting the download of metadata and images. This interface SHOULD be public.</p>
<p>The Image repository SHALL require authorization for writing metadata and images.</p>
<p>The Image repository SHALL provide a method for authorized users to upload images and their associated metadata. It SHALL check that a user writing metadata and images is authorized to do so for that specific image by checking the chain of delegations as described in <a href="#5232-metadata-about-delegations">Section 5.2.3.2</a>.</p>
<p>The Image repository SHALL implement storage that permits authorized users to write an image file using a unique filename, and later read the same file using the same name. It could use any filesystem, key-value store, or database that fulfills this requirement.</p>
<p>The Image repository could require authentication for read access.</p>

<p>The Director repository instructs ECUs as to which images will be installed by producing signed metadata on demand. Unlike the Image repository, it is mostly controlled by automated, online processes. It also consults a private inventory database containing information on vehicles, ECUs, and software revisions.</p>
<p>The Director repository SHALL expose an interface for Primaries to upload vehicle version manifests (<a href="#54211-vehicle-version-manifest">Section 5.4.2.1.1</a>) and download metadata. This interface SHOULD be public.</p>
<p>The Director could encrypt images for ECUs that require them, either by encrypting on-the-fly or by storing encrypted images on the repository.</p>
<p>The Director repository SHALL implement storage that permits an automated service to write generated metadata files. It could use any filesystem, key-value store, or database that fulfills this requirement.</p>

<p>A Director repository SHALL conform to the following six-step process for directing the installation of software images on a vehicle.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Director SHOULD first identify the vehicle. This could be done when the Director receives a vehicle version manifest sent by a Primary (as described in <a href="#5421-construct-and-send-vehicle-version-manifest">Section 5.4.2.1</a>), decodes the manifest, and determines the unique vehicle identifier. Additionally, the Director could utilize other mechanisms to uniquely identify a vehicle (e.g., 2-way TLS with unique client certificates).</li>
<li>Using the vehicle identifier, the Director queries its inventory database (as described in <a href="#5322-inventory-database">Section 5.3.2.2</a>) for relevant information about each ECU in the vehicle.</li>
<li>The Director SHALL check the manifest for accuracy compared to the information in the inventory database. If any of the required checks fail, the Director SHOULD drop the request. An implementer can make additional checks if desired. At a minimum, the Director SHOULD check the following:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Each ECU recorded in the inventory database is also represented in the manifest.</li>
<li>The signature of the manifest matches the ECU key of the Primary that sent it.</li>
<li>The signature of each Secondary’s contribution to the manifest matches the ECU key of that Secondary.</li>
<li>The time sent in the ECU version report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Director SHOULD check that the nonce or counter in each ECU version report has not been used before to prevent a replay of the ECU version report. If the nonce or counter is reused the Director SHOULD drop the request.</li>
<li>The Director extracts information about currently installed images from the vehicle version manifest. Using this information, it determines if the vehicle is already up-to-date, and if not, determines a set of images that could be installed. The exact process by which this determination takes place is out of scope for this Standard. However, the Director SHALL take into account <em>dependencies</em> and <em>conflicts</em> between images and SHOULD consult well-established techniques for dependency resolution.</li>
<li>The Director could encrypt images for ECUs that require it.</li>
<li>The Director generates new metadata representing the desired set of images to be installed on the vehicle, based on the dependency resolution in step 4. This includes Targets (<a href="#523-targets-metadata">Section 5.2.3</a>), Snapshot (<a href="#524-snapshot-metadata">Section 5.2.4</a>), and Timestamp (<a href="#525-timestamp-metadata">Section 5.2.5</a>) metadata. It then sends this metadata to the Primary as described in <a href="#5423-download-and-verify-metadata">Section 5.4.2.3</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Director SHALL use a private inventory database to store information about ECUs and vehicles. An implementer could use any durable database for this purpose.</p>
<p>The inventory database SHALL record the following pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per vehicle:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>A unique identifier (such as a VIN)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Per ECU:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>A unique identifier (such as a serial number)</li>
<li>The vehicle identifier the ECU is associated with</li>
<li>An ECU key (symmetric or asymmetric; for asymmetric keys, only the public part SHOULD be stored)</li>
<li>The ECU key identifier (as defined in <a href="#521-common-metadata-structures">Section 5.2.1</a>)</li>
<li>Whether the ECU is a Primary or a Secondary</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The inventory database can record other information about ECUs and vehicles. It SHOULD record a hardware identifier for each ECU to protect against the possibility of directing the ECU to install incompatible firmware.</p>

In-vehicle implementation requirements" title="Direct link to 5.4. In-vehicle implementation requirements">​</a></h2>
<p>An Uptane-conformant ECU SHALL be able to download and verify image metadata and image binaries before installing a new image and SHALL have a secure way of verifying the current time, or a sufficiently recent attestation of the time.</p>
<p>All ECUs SHALL monitor the download speed of image metadata and image binaries to detect and respond to a slow retrieval attack. If the download is slower than a pre-defined threshold, the ECU SHOULD send an alert to the Director repository, for example as part of the next vehicle version manifest.</p>
<p>Each ECU receiving over-the-air updates in a vehicle is either a Primary or a Secondary ECU. A Primary ECU collects and delivers to the Director vehicle manifests (<a href="#54211-vehicle-version-manifest">Section 5.4.2.1.1</a>) that contain information about which images have been installed on ECUs in the vehicle. It also verifies the time, and downloads and verifies the latest metadata and images for itself and for its Secondaries. A Secondary ECU verifies the time, and downloads and verifies the latest metadata and images for itself from its associated Primary ECU. It also sends signed information about its installed images to its associated Primary.</p>
<p>All ECUs SHALL verify image metadata as specified in <a href="#544-metadata-verification-procedures">Section 5.4.4</a> before installing an image or making it available to other ECUs. A Primary ECU SHALL perform full verification (<a href="#5442-full-verification">Section 5.4.4.2</a>). A Secondary ECU SHOULD perform full verification if possible. If a Secondary cannot perform full verification, it SHALL, at the very least, perform partial verification. In addition, it can also perform some steps from the full verification process. See the <em>Uptane Deployment Best Practices</em> document (<a href="#deploy">[DEPLOY]</a>) for a discussion of how to choose between partial and full verification.</p>
<p>ECUs SHALL have a secure source of time. An OEM/Uptane implementer can use any external source of time that is demonstrably secure.</p>

Build-time prerequisite requirements for ECUs" title="Direct link to 5.4.1. Build-time prerequisite requirements for ECUs">​</a></h2>
<p>For an ECU to be capable of receiving Uptane-secured updates, it SHALL have the following data provisioned at the time it is manufactured or installed in the vehicle:</p>
<ol>
<li>A sufficiently recent copy of required Uptane metadata at the time of manufacture or install. This is necessary for the ECU to authenticate that the remote repository is legitimate when it first downloads metadata in the field. See <em>Uptane Deployment Best Practices</em> (<a href="#deploy">[DEPLOY]</a>) for more information.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Partial verification Secondary ECUs SHALL have the Root and Targets metadata from the Director repository (to reduce the scope of rollback and replay attacks). These ECUs can also have metadata from other roles or the Image repository if they will be used by the Secondary.</li>
<li>Full verification ECUs SHALL have a complete set of metadata (Root, Targets, Snapshot, and Timestamp) from both repositories (to prevent rollback and replay attacks), as well as the repository mapping metadata (<a href="#526-repository-mapping-metadata">Section 5.2.6</a>). Delegations are not required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The current time, or a secure attestation of a sufficiently recent time.</li>
<li><strong>ECU identity keys</strong>. These keys, which are unique to each ECU, are used to sign ECU version reports and decrypt images. ECU identity keya can be either symmetric asymmetric key. If asymmetric keys are used, there SHOULD be separate keys for encryption and signing. For the purposes of this Standard, the set of keys that an ECU uses is referred to as the ECU key (singular), even if it is actually multiple keys used for different purposes. Note that while identity keys are required to be unique to the ECU to avoid replay attacks, the secret keys used to decrypt images need not be unique.</li>

<p>A Primary downloads, verifies, and distributes the latest time, metadata, and images. To do so, it SHALL perform the following seven steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Construct and send vehicle version manifest (<a href="#5421-construct-and-send-vehicle-version-manifest">Section 5.4.2.1</a>)</li>
<li>Download and check current time (<a href="#5422-download-and-check-current-time">Section 5.4.2.2</a>)</li>
<li>Download and verify metadata (<a href="#5423-download-and-verify-metadata">Section 5.4.2.3</a>)</li>
<li>Download and verify images (<a href="#5433-download-latest-images_primary">Section 5.4.2.4</a>)</li>
<li>Send latest time to Secondaries (<a href="#5425-send-latest-time-to-secondaries">Section 5.4.2.5</a>)</li>
<li>Send metadata to Secondaries (<a href="#5426-send-metadata-to-secondaries">Section 5.4.2.6</a>)</li>
<li>Send images to Secondaries (<a href="#5427-send-images-to-secondaries">Section 5.4.2.7</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the subsequent sections concerning requirements for a Primary do not prohibit implementing Primary capabilities on an ECU that does not communicate directly with the Uptane repositories. This allows for implementations to have multiple ECUs within the vehicle performing functions equivalent to a Primary. If multiple such Primaries are included within a vehicle, each Primary SHOULD have a designated set of Secondaries and each Secondary SHALL have at least one Primary responsible for providing its updates</p>

<p>Once the complete manifest is built, the Primary can send the manifest to the Director repository. However, it is not strictly required that the Primary send the manifest until step three. If permitted by the implementation, a Primary could send only a diff of the manifest to save bandwidth. If an implementation permits diffs, the Director SHOULD have a way to request a full manifest.</p>
<p>Secondaries can send their version reports at any time so that they are already stored on the Primary when it wishes to check for updates. Alternatively, the Primary can request a version report from each Secondary at the time of the update check.</p>

<p>A Primary ECU SHALL perform full verification of metadata. A Secondary ECU SHOULD perform full verification of metadata. If a Secondary cannot perform full verification, it SHALL, at the very least, perform partial verification.</p>
<p>If a step in the following workflows does not succeed (e.g., the update is aborted because a new metadata file was not signed), an ECU SHOULD still be able to update again in the future. Errors raised during the update process SHOULD NOT leave ECUs in an unrecoverable state.</p>

<p>In order to perform partial verification, an ECU SHALL perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load and verify the current time or the most recent securely attested time.</li>
<li>Download and check the Targets metadata file from the Director repository, following the procedure in <a href="#5446-how-to-check-targets-metadata">Section 5.4.4.6</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this verification procedure is the smallest set of Uptane checks permissible for an Uptane Secondary ECU. An ECU can additionally implement more metadata checks.</p>
<p>For example, an ECU could also fetch and verify Root metadata from the Director (following the procedure in <a href="#5443-how-to-check-root-metadata">Section 5.4.4.3</a>) before checking Targets metadata. Performing this additional check would provide the ECU with a secure way to receive and validate a rotation of the Director’s Targets key.</p>
<p>See <a href="#deploy">[DEPLOY]</a> for more discussion on this topic.</p>

<p>Full verification of metadata means that the ECU checks that the Targets metadata about images from the Director repository matches the Targets metadata about the same images from the Image repository. This provides resilience to a key compromise in the system.</p>
<p>Full verification SHALL be performed by Primary ECUs and SHOULD be performed by Secondary ECUs. In the following instructions, whenever an ECU is directed to download metadata, it applies only to Primary ECUs.</p>
<p>Before starting full verification, the repository mapping metadata SHALL be consulted to determine where to download metadata from. This procedure assumes the basic Uptane case: there are only two repositories (Director and Image), and all image paths are required to be signed by both repositories. If a more complex repository layout is being used, refer to <a href="#deploy">[DEPLOY]</a> for guidance on how to determine where metadata could be downloaded from.</p>
<p>In order to perform full verification, an ECU SHALL perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load and verify the current time or the most recent securely attested time.</li>
<li>Download and check the Root metadata file from the Director repository, following the procedure in <a href="#5443-how-to-check-root-metadata">Section 5.4.4.3</a>.</li>
<li>Download and check the Timestamp metadata file from the Director repository, following the procedure in <a href="#5444-how-to-check-timestamp-metadata">Section 5.4.4.4</a>.</li>
<li>Check the previously downloaded Snapshot metadata file from the Directory repository (if available). If the hashes and version number of that file match the hashes and version number listed in the new Timestamp metadata, there are no new updates and the verification process SHALL be stopped and considered complete. Otherwise, download and check the Snapshot metadata file from the Director repository, following the procedure in <a href="#5445-how-to-check-snapshot-metadata">Section 5.4.4.5</a>.</li>
<li>Download and check the Targets metadata file from the Director repository, following the procedure in <a href="#5446-how-to-check-targets-metadata">Section 5.4.4.6</a>.</li>
<li>If the Targets metadata from the Directory repository indicates that there are no new targets that are not already currently installed, the verification process SHOULD be stopped and considered complete. Optionally, implementors can order vehicles to check image repo root metadata when desirable, even in the absence of an update. Otherwise, download and check the Root metadata file from the Image repository, following the procedure in <a href="#5443-how-to-check-root-metadata">Section 5.4.4.3</a>.</li>
<li>Download and check the Timestamp metadata file from the Image repository, following the procedure in <a href="#5444-how-to-check-timestamp-metadata">Section 5.4.4.4</a>.</li>
<li>Check the previously downloaded Snapshot metadata file from the Image repository (if available). If the hashes and version number of that file match the hashes and version number listed in the new Timestamp metadata, the ECU SHALL skip to the last step. Otherwise, download and check the Snapshot metadata file from the Image repository, following the procedure in <a href="#5445-how-to-check-snapshot-metadata">Section 5.4.4.5</a>.</li>
<li>Download and check the top-level Targets metadata file from the Image repository, following the procedure in <a href="#5446-how-to-check-targets-metadata">Section 5.4.4.6</a>.</li>
<li>Verify that Targets metadata from the Director and Image repositories match. A Primary ECU SHALL perform this check on metadata for all images listed in the Targets metadata file from the Director repository downloaded in step 6. A Secondary ECU can elect to perform this check only on the metadata for the image it will install. (That is, the image metadata from the Director that contains the ECU identifier of the current ECU.) To check that the metadata for an image matches, complete the following procedure:</li>
<li>Locate and download a Targets metadata file from the Image repository that contains an image with exactly the same filename listed in the Director metadata, following the procedure in <a href="#5447-how-to-resolve-delegations">Section 5.4.4.7</a>.</li>
<li>Check that the Targets metadata from the Image repository matches the Targets metadata from the Director repository:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Check that the non-custom metadata (i.e., length and hashes) of the unencrypted or encrypted image are the same in both sets of metadata. Note: the Primary is responsible for validating encrypted images and associated metadata. The target ECU (Primary or Secondary) is responsible for validating the unencrypted image and associated metadata.</li>
<li>Check that all SHALL match custom metadata (e.g., hardware identifier and release counter) are the same in both sets of metadata.</li>
<li>Check that the release counter, if one is used, in the previous Targets metadata file is less than or equal to the release counter in this Targets metadata file.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If any step fails, the ECU SHALL return an error code indicating the failure. If a check for a specific type of security attack fails (i.e., rollback, freeze, arbitrary software, etc.), the ECU SHOULD return an error code that indicates the type of attack.</p>

<p>To properly check Root metadata, an ECU SHOULD:</p>

<li>Try downloading a new version N+1 of the Root metadata file, up to some X number of bytes. The value for X is set by the implementer. For example, X could be tens of kilobytes. The filename used to download the Root metadata file is of the fixed form VERSION_NUMBER.FILENAME.EXT (e.g., 42.root.json). If this file is not available, the current Root metadata file is the latest; continue with step 3.</li>
<li>Version N+1 of the Root metadata file SHALL have been signed by the following: (1) a threshold of unique keys specified in the latest Root metadata file (version N), and (2) a threshold of unique keys specified in the new Root metadata file being validated (version N+1).

<li>The version number of the latest Root metadata file (version N) SHALL be less than or equal to the version number of the new Root metadata file (version N+1). Effectively, this means checking that the version number signed in the new Root metadata file is indeed N+1. If the version of the new Root metadata file is less than the latest metadata file, discard it, abort the update cycle, and report the rollback attack. On the next update cycle, begin at step 1 and version N of the Root metadata file. (Checks for a rollback attack.)</li>
<li>Set the latest Root metadata file to the new Root metadata file.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2.1 to 2.6.</li>
