      A predecessor technology of Uptane, The Update Framework (TUF), which
      secures software updates on repositories, is introduced in an
      [academic research paper](../static/papers/samuel_ccs_2010.pdf),
      coauthored by Justin Samuel and Justin Cappos.

    Cappos, along with Trishank Kuppusamy, and Vladimir Diaz begin
    adapting TUF for Python, Ruby, and environments used for cloud
    computing. Kuppusamy, a Ph.D. student at the time, will later use
    this experience on the Uptane project.

      NYU Tandon receives a grant (with Cappos as PI) from the U.S.
      Department of Homeland Security to begin work on a project to
      secure software updates on vehicles. University of Michigan
      Transportation Research Institute(UMTRI) and Southwest Research
      Institute(SWRI) receive a similar grant to work on automotive
      security.

          A consortium of researchers at UMTRI, SWRI, and NYU Tandon
          begin developing Uptane, using the basic TUF design as a
          starting point.
    </p>
    <p>
        The research team also begins holding a series of workshops
        (organized by Andre Weimerskirch at UMTRI) at which auto companies,
         suppliers, and representatives of government agencies meet to
         review and comment on the work in progress. The team also
         establishes an online forum, where issues could be raised and
         discussed. Both of these steps help to ensure
         alignment with the intended market.

        [_Uptane: Securing Software Updates for Automobiles_](../static/papers/kuppusamy_escar_16.pdf)
        is presented at [escar Europe](https://www.escar.info/escar-europe/history.html)
        by lead author Kuppusamy. This marked the first presentation of the
        project to an academic audience.
