# Timeline

**2010**:  A predecessor technology of Uptane, The Update Framework (TUF), which
secures software updates on repositories, is introduced in an [academic research paper](papers/samuel_ccs_2010.pdf),
coauthored by Justin Samuel and Justin Cappos.

**2013**:  Cappos, along with Trishank Kuppusamy, and Vladimir Diaz begin
adapting TUF for Python, Ruby, and environments used
for cloud computing.  Kuppusamy, a Ph.D. student at the time, will later
use this experience on the Uptane project.

**2015**: [NYU Tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) receives a grant (with 
Cappos as PI) from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to begin work on 
a project to secure software updates on vehicles.  [University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute](https://umtri.umich.edu/)(UMTRI)
and [Southwest Research Institute](https://www.swri.org/)(SWRI) receive a 
similar grant to work on automotive security.

**2016**: Uptane is created when a consortium of researchers at
UMTRI, SWRI, and NYU Tandon begin developing Uptane, using the basic 
TUF design as a starting point.

**2016** The research team also begins a series of workshops (organized by
Andre Weimerskirch at UMTRI) at which OEMs (original equipment manufacturers,
ie. the auto companies), suppliers, and representatives of government agencies
meet to review and comment on the work in progress, and an online forum,
where issues could be raised and discussed. Both of these steps help to ensure
alignment with the intended market.

**2016**: [*Uptane: Securing Software Updates for Automobiles*](papers/kuppusamy_escar_16.pdf)
is presented at [escar 16](https://www.escar.info/escar-europe/history.html) by
lead author Kuppusamy. This
marked the first presentation of the project to an academic audience.

**2017**: Uptane is officially introduced at [press events](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/01/19/uptane-will-protect-your-connected-car-from-hackers/#233b99d019be) in Ann Arbor, MI, and Brooklyn, NY.

**2017**: Advanced Telematic Systems (ATS), now [HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/),
becomes one of the first suppliers to publicly [acknowledge adoption](https://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2017/06/connected-car-news-marvell-telit-att-ats-continental-toyota-marvel-safe-drive-systems-cast-car2go-trimble/) of Uptane when it integrates the framework
into two of its OTA solutions, OTA Plus and ATS Garage.

**2017**: Uptane is named one of the year's most important innovations in
security by [*Popular Science*](https://www.popsci.com/top-security-innovations-2017/).

**2018**: [Airbiquity](https://www.airbiquity.com) receives a
[BIG Award for Business](https://www.airbiquity.com/news/press-releases/airbiquity-otamatic-named-2017-new-product-year-business-intelligence-group) in the 2017 New Product of the Year Award category for its
Uptane-based OTAmatic over-the-air software and data management solution.

**2018**: An open source, C++ implementation of Uptane called [aktualizr](https://github.com/uptane/aktualizr)
is developed by Advanced Telematic Systems (subsequently acquired by
[HERE technologies](https://www.here.com/en)).  aktualizr
is integrated into [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/) (AGL),
a collaborative open source project in which
automakers, suppliers and technology companies work together to advance the
development and adoption of a fully open software stack for the connected car.

**2018**: NYU Tandon School of Engineering becomes an associate member of the
[Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and a Bronze member of AGL
on the strength of the Foundation’s adoption of Uptane and TUF projects.

**2018**: The Uptane Alliance, a nonprofit entity organized under the umbrella of
IEEE's [International Standards and Technology Organization](https://ieee-isto.org/) is formed.
As an ISTO supported organization, the Alliance will oversee the setting of 
standards for the implementation/deployment of Uptane, as well as the 
advancement and improvement of the technology itself.

**2019**: The IEEE/ISTO standardizes the version 1.0.0 of the Uptane specification.

**2019**: The Uptane Alliance joins the Linux Foundation's Joint Development Foundation, giving
a pathway for ISO standardization of future versions of the specification.

**2020**: The Uptane standard working group releases version 1.0.1 of the Uptane standard with minor corrections. Because of the organizational move to the Linux Foundation's Joint Development Foundation, this cannot be formally released as an update to the IEEE-ISTO standard. However, it should be considered as an errata/patch release updating the content of that standard.

**2021**: The Uptane Standard working group releases versions 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 of the Uptane standard.

**2021**: Uptane releases its first whitepaper: [Uptane: Securing delivery of software updates for
ground vehicles](https://uptane.github.io/papers/Uptane_first_whitepaper.pdf).
