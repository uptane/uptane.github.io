The basic principles of Uptane, and the framework's development over time, are addressed in some detail in a series of Powerpoint presentations originally put together for Uptane industry workshops and conferences. Links to these slides appear below, including two slide decks from its most recent programs targeted to international audiences. These include a virtual program held in October 2022, and an in-person program held in December 2022\.

This section also includes links to a demo video explaining how Uptane works, and to a video of Trishank Kuppusamy delivering the first academic talk on Uptane at escar 16.

- [Software Bill of Materials Overview](../../static/papers/23uptane_331_hart.pdf) An overview slide presentation on SBOMs prepared by Charles Hart of Hitachi America R&D for the Uptane conference to be held March 31, 2023.

It was created for a virtual conference to be held March 31, 2023.

- [Uptane: Open Source Summit Japan: Securing Software Updates and Supply Chains on Connected Vehicles](../../static/papers/22uptane_yokohama_december_7.pdf) This slide set, created for presentation at the Linux Foundation's Open Source Summit in Japan, is a somewhat simplified version of the escar presentation from earlier in the year. It emphasizes the current status of the Uptane project and provides an excellent introduction to its basic design principles, its defensive strategies against specific threats, and how it continues to evolve to meet the needs of the industry.

- [Uptane Virtual Industry Conference: Securing Software Updates and Supply Chains on Connected Vehicles](../../static/papers/22uptane_october_22_presentationmain.pdf) This set of slides collects the presentations of six of the speakers at the 2022 Uptane Virtual Conference, which featured an updated overview of the framework and its evolution, particularly over the past few years. The slides also describe how Uptane is approaching emerging needs in the automotive industry, such as software supply chain security and dealing with aftermarket ECUs. Three other slide decks, from featured presenters Suzanne Lightman, Nick Russell, and David Kruger are described below.

- [ISO 24089 (and a Little Bit of SAE/ISO 21434)](../../static/papers/Lightman_ISO_24089.pdf) Presented by Suzanne Lightman, Senior Advisor at the Computer Security Division of the Information Technology Lab at the National Institute for Standards and Technology, this slide deck provides relevant information to the Uptane community about conformance with these important industry standards.

- [UNECE WP.29 regulations](/papers/22uptane_russell_UNECEWP.29.pdf) Presented by Nick Russell, Director of Standards for Blackberry, the slide deck offers a deep dive into the history, motivation, and application of two recent regulations from the United Nations UNECE Working Party 29: UN R 155 and R156.

- [Over the Air Updates: PACCAR ITD](../../static/papers/Over-the-Air-Updates-PACCAR.pdf) Presented by David Kruger, a domain architect in the PACCAR Information Technology Division, these slides share how his company--which designs, manufactures and provides customer support to premium light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks under the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF nameplates--selected and implemented Uptane into its OTA system.

- [Securing Over-the-Air Updates Against Nation State Actors-September 2021](../../static/papers/IIW21_session1.pdf) These slides, created for our first international workshop held under the auspices of escar Europe, present an overview of the motivation behind Uptane, a basic description of how the technology works, and some thoughts on its future directions. Included are a number of slides that were not part of the formal presentation that offer valuable information on Uptane to those new to the framework.

- [Uptane: Lessons Learned-September 2021](../../static/papers/IIW21_session2.pdf) The second set of slides from the September 2021 international conference presents some examples where the Uptane technology responded to--or is currently responding to--specific stakeholder feedback. The examples include how to handle verification for secondary ECUs, and suggestion for Uptane implementations evolving from legacy systems.

- [Lightning Update of Uptane-May 2020](../../static/papers/IW20_lightning_update.pdf) This set of slides explaining the basics about what Uptane is and does, and what has changed over the past year.
