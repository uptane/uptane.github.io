# Participate

We welcome questions, feedback, and suggestions on any aspect of this project.
Feel free to email feedback to [jcappos@nyu.edu](mailto:jcappos@nyu.edu).

Anyone in the automotive industry, open source community, or security community
is welcome to join the
[Uptane Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/uptane-forum).
This is a fairly low volume mailing list (a few messages a week) and is used
to disseminate large news items, or to plan in person Uptane workshops.

### Standards Development
The Uptane standardization initiative is under the direction of the Uptane
Steering Committee and is carried out on a
[mailing list created specifically for this purpose](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/uptane-standards).
This mailing list is higher volume (often multiple messages a day) and is
mainly meant to coordinate the standardization effort. To be added to this list, send an email to [lad278@nyu.edu](mailto:lad278@nyu.edu).

### Membership Status in JDF/Uptane
We welcome all interested parties to join either mailing list, independent of  
whether or not your organization joins the Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC, Uptane Series.  (However, if your
organization does wish to join this group, please contact jcappos@nyu.edu
for more information on how to do so.)

### Code Contributions

If submitting any new software feature or change, please include or update appropriate unit tests.

All submitted pull requests undergo review and automated testing, including, but not limited to:
* Unit and build testing via Travis CI

### Code Issues, Bugs, Feature Requests

If you wish to report a bug or a security issue, or introduce a new feature to
the specification, please [open an issue](https://github.com/uptane/uptane-standard/issues/new)
on this.

### Security Audits

We welcome security audits of the Uptane design and vulnerability reports of
the design or any code in the [Uptane GitHub namespace](https://github.com/uptane). Please contact lab director
[Justin Cappos](mailto:jcappos@nyu.edu) or maintainer [Lois Anne DeLong](mailto:lad278@nyu.edu).
Uptane design and implementation is defined in the [Uptane Standards document](https://uptane.github.io/uptane-standard/uptane-standard.html) and supplemented by the [Deployment Best Practices document](https://uptane.github.io/deployment-considerations/index.html).

Should the information be highly sensitive, auditors / reporters may employ
PGP encryption in an email to Justin Cappos using the public key whose PGP
fingerprint is: E9C0 59EC 0D32 64FA B35F  94AD 465B F9F6 F8EB 475A.

Audits of TUF alone (which Uptane employs) should be submitted
[per these instructions](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/GOVERNANCE.md#tuf-governance) to the TUF project team.
