<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Uptane is a secure software update framework for ground vehicles. This document describes procedures to enable programmers for OEMs and suppliers to securely design and implement this framework in a manner that better protects connected units on ground vehicles. Integrating Uptane as outlined in the sections that follow can reduce the ability of attackers to compromise critical systems. It also assures a faster and easier recovery process should a compromise occur.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">These instructions specify the components necessary for a compliant implementation. Individual implementors can make their own technological choices within those requirements. This flexibility makes Uptane adaptable to the many customized update solutions used by manufacturers. If implementors wish to have compatible formats, they may use POUFs. POUFs contain a description of implementation choices as well as data binding formats. An implementor who adopts a POUF, as well as the Uptane Standard, will be able to interoperate with other implementations using that POUF.</p>

<p><em>Bundle</em>: A set of images released by the repository that is meant to be installed by one or more target ECUs on a vehicle during the same update cycle.</p>
<p><em>Bus</em>: An internal communications network that interconnects components within a vehicle. A vehicle can have a number of buses that will vary in terms of power, speed and resources.</p>
<p><em>ECU Identifier</em>: An attribute used to identify a specific ECU (e.g., such as a unique serial number).</p>
<p><em>ECU Version Manifest</em>: Metadata which details the software version currently installed on the ECU.</p>
<p><em>Hardware Identifier</em>: An attribute used to identify a model of an ECU.</p>
<p><em>Image</em>: File containing software for an ECU to install. May contain a binary image to flash, installation instructions, and other necessary information for the ECU to properly apply the update. Each ECU typically holds only one image, although this may vary in some cases.</p>
<p><em>Metadata</em>:  Information describing the characteristics of data including, for example, structural metadata describing data structures (e.g., data format, syntax, and semantics) and descriptive metadata describing data contents (e.g., information security labels). As used in Uptane, metadata can be described as information associated with a role or an image that contains the characteristics or parameters thereof (e.g. cryptographic material parameters, file names and versions.)</p>
<p><em>Primary/Secondary ECUs</em>: Terms used to describe the control units within a ground vehicle. A primary ECU downloads and verifies update images and metadata for itself and for secondary ECUs, and distributes images and metadata to secondaries. Thus, it requires extra storage space and a means to download images and metadata.  Secondary ECUs receive their update images and metadata from the primary, and only need to verify and install their own metadata and images.</p>
<p><em>POUF</em>: A document that contains the protocol, operations, usage, and formats (POUF) of a specific Uptane implementation. The POUF contains decisions about SHOULDs and MAYs in an implementation, as well as descriptions of data binding formats. POUFs MAY be used to create compatible Uptane implementations.</p>
<p><em>Repository</em>: A server containing metadata about images. May also contain the images themselves. Other data may be stored on the repository to be accessed by ECUs during the update process.</p>
<p><em>Suppliers</em>: Independent companies to which auto manufacturers may outsource the production of ECUs. Tier-1 suppliers directly serve the manufacturers. Tier-2 suppliers are those that perform outsourced work for Tier-1 suppliers.</p>
<p><em>Vehicle Version Manifest</em>: A compilation of all ECU version manifests on a vehicle. It serves as a master list of all images currently running on all ECUs in the vehicle.</p>

<ul>
<li>The number of connected units on the average vehicle continues to grow, with mainstream cars now containing up to 100 million lines of code. <a href="#USATODAY" class="xref">[USATODAY]</a>

<li>The expanded use of software over-the-air strategies creates new attack surfaces for malicious parties. <a href="#CR-OTA" class="xref">[CR-OTA]</a>
</li>
<li>Legacy update strategies, such as SSL/TLS or GPG/RSA, are not feasible for use on vehicle ECUs because they force manufacturers to chose between enhanced security and customizability.</li>
<li>Conventional strategies are also complicated by the differing resources of the ECUs, which can vary greatly in memory, storage space, and Internet connectivity.</li>
<li>The design of Uptane makes it possible to offer improved design flexibility, without sacrificing security.</li>
<li>This added design flexibility, however, could be a liability if the framework is implemented incorrectly.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.6.p.2">Repository mapping metadata informs a Primary ECU about which repositories to trust for images or image paths. <a href="#TAP-4" class="xref">[TAP-4]</a> describes how to make use of more complex repository mapping metadata in order to have more than the two required repositories.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.6.p.3">Repository mapping metadata, or the equivalent informational content, MUST be present on all Primary ECUs, and MUST contain the following information:</p>

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Metadata filenames SHALL be qualified with version numbers.

<li>If an image is specified in a Targets metadata file as FILENAME.EXT, it SHALL be written to the repository as HASH.FILENAME.EXT, where HASH is one of the hash digests of the file, as specified in <a href="#targets_images_meta" class="xref">Section 5.2.3.1</a>.

<li>The Director SHALL check the manifest for accuracy compared to the information in the inventory database. If any of the required checks fail, the Director MAY drop the request. An implementer MAY make additional checks if desired. At a minimum, the Director SHALL check the following: <ul>
<li>Each ECU recorded in the inventory database is also represented in the manifest.</li>
<li>The signature of the manifest matches the ECU key of the Primary that sent it.</li>
<li>The signature of each Secondary&#8217;s contribution to the manifest matches the ECU key of that Secondary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Director SHOULD check that the nonce or counter in each ECU Version Report has not been used before to prevent a replay of the ECU Version Report. If the nonce or counter is reused the Director SHOULD drop the request.</li>
<li>The Director extracts information about currently installed images from the vehicle version manifest. Using this information, it determines if the vehicle is already up-to-date, and if not, determines a set of images that should be installed. The exact process by which this determination takes place is out of scope of this standard. However, the Director MUST take into account <em>dependencies</em> and <em>conflicts</em> between images and SHOULD consult well-established techniques for dependency resolution.</li>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.4.7.p.1">To properly check Targets metadata for an image, an ECU MUST locate the metadata file(s) for the role (or roles) that have the authority to sign the image. This metadata might be located in the top-level Targets metadata, but it also may be delegated to another role or to multiple roles. Therefore, all delegations MUST be resolved using the following recursive procedure, beginning with the top-level Targets metadata file.</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Download the current metadata file, and check it following the procedure in <a href="#check_targets" class="xref">Section 5.4.4.6</a>. If the file cannot be loaded, or if any verification step fails, abort the delegation resolution, and indicate that Image metadata cannot be found because of a missing or invalid role.</li>
<li>If the current metadata file contains signed metadata about the image, end the delegation resolution and return the metadata to be checked.</li>
<li>If the current metadata file was reached via a terminating delegation and does not contain signed metadata about the image, abort the delegation resolution for this image and return an error indicating that image metadata could not be found.</li>
<li>Search the list of delegations, in listed order. For each delegation: <ol>
<li>Check if the delegation applies to the image being processed. For the delegation to apply, it MUST include the hardware identifier of the target, and the target name must match one of the delegation&#8217;s image paths. If either of these tests fail, move on to the next delegation in the list.</li>
<li>If the delegation is a multi-role delegation, follow the procedure described in <a href="#multirole_delegations" class="xref">Section 5.4.4.8</a>. If the multi-role delegation is terminating and no valid Image metadata is found, abort the delegation resolution and return an error indicating that image metadata could not be found.</li>
<li>If the delegation is a normal delegation, perform delegation resolution, starting at step 1. Note that this may recurse an arbitrary number of levels deep. If a delegation that applies to the image is found but no image metadata is found in the delegated roles or any of its sub-delegations, simply continue on with the next delegation in the list. The search is only completed/aborted if image metadata or a terminating delegation that applies to the image is found.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the end of the list of delegations in the top-level metadata is reached without finding valid image metadata, return an error indicating that image metadata could not be found.</li>
</ol>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.4.8.p.1">It is possible to delegate signing authority to multiple delegated roles as described in <a href="#TAP-3" class="xref">[TAP-3]</a>. Each multi-role delegation effectively contains a list of ordinary delegations, plus a threshold of those roles that must be in agreement about the non-custom metadata for the image. All multi-role delegations MUST be resolved using the following procedure. Note that there may be sub-delegations inside multi-role delegations.</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>For each of the roles in the delegation, find and load the image metadata (or error) following the procedure in <a href="#resolve_delegations" class="xref">Section 5.4.4.7</a>.</li>
<li>Inspect the non-custom part of the metadata loaded in step 1: <ol>
<li>Locate all sets of roles which have agreeing (i.e. identical) non-custom metadata and &#8220;MUST match&#8221; custom metadata. Discard any set of roles with a size smaller than the threshold of roles that must be in agreement for this delegation.</li>
<li>Check for a conflict. A conflict exists if there remains more than one agreeing set of roles, each set having different metadata. If a conflict is found, choose and return the metadata from the set of roles which includes the earliest role in the multi-delegation list.</li>
<li>If there is no conflict, check if there is any single set of roles with matching non-custom metadata. If there is, choose and return the metadata from this set.</li>
<li>If no agreeing set can be found that meets the agreement threshold, return an error indicating that image metadata could not be found.</li>
