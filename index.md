#### Uptane will be holding a hybrid online/in-person conference on June 23, 2023, from 10 am to 1:15 pm EDT. The free event will feature presentations on software supply chain security, automotive crypto agility, and examples of two different Uptane Integration Experiences that reflect the continuing evolution of the technology in both transportation and other applications. Please [click here](https://nyu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUvde2grDItGNVxxJPl11Rub_V2setyph-A) to register or [here](/papers/Uptane_meeting_agenda_62323.pdf) for an up-to-date agenda of the meeting program. Note that the agenda references a brief brainstorming session from 1:15 to 2:00 p.m. This discussion will be among those attending the in-person event. We do not have the technical capabilities to share this session with our online participants, however, we will share a summary of the ideas generated in this session in some form at a later date.

####  If you act quickly, you still have the option of reserving a spot at our in-person event. To do, please [register here](https://forms.gle/yqdGRTD1Vo2j385B6).
=======================

Uptane is an open and secure software update framework design which protects software delivered over-the-air to
automobile electronic control units (ECUs).  The framework protects against malicious actors who can
compromise servers and networks used to sign and deliver updates.  Hence, it is designed to be resilient even to the best efforts of nation state
attackers. There are multiple different free open source and closed source
implementations available.  Uptane is integrated into [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/),
an open source system currently used by many large OEMs, and has also been adopted by a number of U.S. and international manufacturers.

Uptane was first created in 2016 in a collaboration between [NYU](https://engineering.nyu.edu/), [UMTRI](https://www.umtri.umich.edu/), [SwRI](https://www.swri.org/), and automotive industry experts. It was developed as an open source framework under a grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It expands on [The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.io/), used in many production software update systems. In July 2018, formal standardization of Uptane began under a non-profit consortium called the [Uptane
Alliance](https://ieee-isto.org/member_programs/uptane-alliance/). [Uptane Standard for Design and Implementation](https://github.com/uptane/uptane-standard/releases/download/1.0.0/ieee-isto-6100.1.0.0.uptane-standard.html) version 1.0, which presents procedures for secure design and implementation of the framework, was released on July 31, 2019, under the auspices of the [IEEE/ISTO Federation](https://ieee-isto.org/). The initiative now
continues as a Linux Foundation Joint Development Foundation project, with versions [1.1.0](/papers/uptane-standard.1.1.0.html) and [1.2.0](/papers/uptane-standard.1.2.0.html) released in 2021, and version [2.0.0](/papers/uptane-standard.2.0.0.html) released in 2022. The most recent version, [2.1.0](/uptane-standard/2.1.0/uptane-standard.html) was released in June 2023. Recommended deployment strategies are under active development, and are published and regularly updated [on this site](/deployment-considerations/index.html). All Uptane materials, including [technical papers](https://uptane.github.io/publications.html), and
[security audits](https://uptane.github.io/audits.html) are also freely available for all to use without a fee.
