# Project Overview

Uptane is the first software update security system for the automotive
industry capable of resisting even attacks by nation-state level actors.  It
is designed in such a manner that the security of software updates
does not degrade all at once, but follows a hierarchy in which different
levels of access to vehicles or the automaker's infrastructure must be gained.
By building these levels into the security system, even if an
attacker compromises servers, bribes operators, or gains access to vehicular
networks, he or she is prevented from causing [many types of harm to the
vehicle](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pBK--40BCg_ofww4GES0weYFB6tZRedAjUy6PJ4Rgzk/edit#heading=h.ertrftdz3oms).

Equally important is that Uptane provides a method
to authenticate software updates before they are installed on the connected
units that control vital components, such as brakes and door locks, despite
adversarial interference,  In doing
so, Uptane provides a solution to a growing threat vector targeting cars and
trucks—malware disguised as software updates.

The Uptane framework is flexible and can be incorporated into the existing
types of software update strategies already used by OEMs.  Whether it is
an end user updating
his or her own vehicle using flash drives, over-the-air updates, or
[automated operations](https://sbabic.github.io/swupdate/overview.html)
using package managers, all can benefit from Uptane's security with very low
operational overhead.

Uptane was developed as open source software under a grant from
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and is completely free for anyone
to use.  It  was created by a team of researchers from the New York University
Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn, NY, the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute in Ann Arbor, MI, and the Southwest Research
Institute in Austin, TX. The three partner
institutions worked in close collaboration with vehicle manufacturers and
suppliers that are collectively responsible for [78% of the vehicles on U.S. roads.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8278174&tag=1 )

In 2017, Popular Science named Uptane one of the
[top security inventions of 2017,](https://www.popsci.com/top-security-innovations-2017/)
and the OTAmatic program of Airbiquity, in which Uptane is a key security component,
was awarded a [BIG Award for Business](https://www.bintelligence.com/big-awards-for-business/) in
the New Product Category. In 2018, NYU Tandon School of
Engineering became an [associate member](https://www.automotivelinux.org/announcements/automotive-grade-linux-extends-global-reach-with-six-new-members/) of the [Linux Foundation,](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)
and a member of the [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/) project,
in part due to the Foundation's adoption of Uptane technology.

On July 2018, the [Uptane Alliance](https://ieee-isto.org/member_programs/uptane-alliance/), a non-profit, was formed under [IEEE/ISTO](https://ieee-isto.org/) to
lead the future direction of Uptane research, development, and deployment. A year later, the Alliance released Volume 1.0 of [Uptane Standard for Design and Implementation](https://github.com/uptane/uptane-standard/releases/download/1.0.0/ieee-isto-6100.1.0.0.uptane-standard.html). Uptane is now legally known as Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC, Uptane Series, and continues its work under the auspices of the Linux Foundation.
The primary task of this group is still to be a neutral arbiter to oversee the
formal standardization of Uptane and, in general, promote security of software updates for the automotive industry.
