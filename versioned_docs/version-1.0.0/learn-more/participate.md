# Participate

We welcome questions, feedback, and suggestions on any aspect of this project. Feel free to email feedback to <jcappos@nyu.edu>.

Anyone in the automotive industry, open source community, or security community is welcome to join the [Uptane Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/uptane-forum). This is a fairly low volume mailing list (a few messages a week) and is used to disseminate large news items, or to plan in person Uptane workshops.

## Standards Development

The Uptane standardization initiative is under the direction of the Uptane Steering Committee and is carried out on a [mailing list created specifically for this purpose](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/uptane-standards). This mailing list is higher volume (often multiple messages a day) and is mainly meant to coordinate the standardization effort. To be added to this list, send an email to <lad278@nyu.edu>.

## Membership Status in JDF/Uptane

We welcome all interested parties to join either mailing list, independent of<br/>
whether or not your organization joins the Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC, Uptane Series. (However, if your organization does wish to join this group, please contact jcappos@nyu.edu for more information on how to do so.)

## Code Contributions

To make contributions to this or any other Uptane repository on GitHub, please submit a pull request to this repository using [these development instructions](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/lab-guidelines/blob/master/dev-workflow.md). If submitting any new software feature or change, please include or update appropriate unit tests.

All submitted pull requests undergo review and automated testing, including, but not limited to:

- Unit and build testing via Travis CI

## Code Issues, Bugs, Feature Requests

If you wish to report a bug or a security issue, or introduce a new feature to the specification, please [open an issue](https://github.com/uptane/uptane-standard/issues/new) on this.

## Security Audits

We welcome security audits of the Uptane design and vulnerability reports of the design or any code in the [Uptane GitHub namespace](https://github.com/uptane). Please contact lab director [Justin Cappos](mailto:jcappos@nyu.edu) or maintainer [Lois Anne DeLong](mailto:lad278@nyu.edu). Uptane design and implementation is defined in the [Uptane Standards document](https://uptane.github.io/uptane-standard/uptane-standard.html) and supplemented by the [Deployment Best Practices document](https://uptane.github.io/deployment-considerations/index.html).

Should the information be highly sensitive, auditors / reporters may employ PGP encryption in an email to Justin Cappos using the public key whose PGP fingerprint is: E9C0 59EC 0D32 64FA B35F 94AD 465B F9F6 F8EB 475A.

Audits of TUF alone (which Uptane employs) should be submitted [per these instructions](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs/GOVERNANCE.md#tuf-governance) to the TUF project team.
