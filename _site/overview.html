<h3 id="what-is-a-software-update-system">What is a software update system?</h3>

<p>Generally, a software update system is an application (or part of an
application) running on a client system that obtains and installs software.
These systems typically update the applications installed on client systems to
introduce new features, enhancements, and security fixes.</p>

<p>Three major classes of software update systems are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Application updaters</strong> which are used by applications to update
 themselves. For example, Firefox updates itself through its own application
 updater.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Library package managers</strong> such as those offered by many
 programming languages for installing additional libraries. These are systems
 such as Python’s pip/easy_install + PyPI, Perl’s CPAN, Ruby’s RubyGems, and
 PHP’s Composer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>System package managers</strong> used by operating systems to update and
 install all of the software on a client system. Debian’s APT, Red Hat’s YUM,
 and openSUSE’s YaST are examples of these.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="our-approach">Our approach</h3>

<p>There are literally thousands of different software update systems in common
use today. (In fact the average Windows user has about <a href="http://secunia.com/gfx/pdf/Secunia_RSA_Software_Portfolio_Security_Exposure.pdf">two
dozen</a>
different software updaters on their machine!)</p>

<p>We are building a library that can be universally (and in most cases
transparently) used to secure software update systems.</p>

<h3 id="overview-1">Overview</h3>

<p>On the surface, the update procedure followed by a software update system can
be regarded as straightforward.  Obtaining and installing an update just means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Knowing when an update exists.</li>
  <li>Downloading the update.</li>
  <li>Applying the changes introduced by the update.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with this view is that it is only straightforward when there are no
malicious parties involved throughout the update procedure. If an attacker is
trying to interfere with these seemingly simple steps, there is plenty that
they can do.</p>

<p>TUF is designed to perform the first two steps of the above update procedure,
while guarding against the majority of attacks that malicious actors have at
their disposal; especially those attacks that are overlooked by
security-conscious developers.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Let’s assume you take the approach that most systems do (at least, the ones
that even try to be secure). You download both the file you want and a
cryptographic signature of the file. You already know which key you trust to
make the signature. You check that the signature is correct and was made by
this trusted key. All seems well, right? Wrong. You are still at risk in many
ways, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An attacker keeps giving you the same file, so you never realize
there is an update.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An attacker gives you an older, insecure version of a file that you
already have, so you download that one and blindly use it thinking it’s
newer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An attacker gives you a newer version of a file you have but it’s not
the newest one. It’s newer to you, but it may be insecure and
exploitable by the attacker.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An attacker compromises the key used to sign these files and now you
download a malicious file that is properly signed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These are just some of the attacks software update systems are vulnerable to
when only using signed files. See <a href="/security.md">Security</a> for a full list of
attacks and updater weaknesses TUF is designed to prevent.</p>

<p>The following papers provide detailed information on securing software updater
systems, TUF’s design and implementation details, attacks on package managers,
and package management security:</p>

<h3 id="what-tuf-does">What TUF does</h3>

<p>In order to securely download and verify target files, TUF requires a few extra
files to exist on a repository. These are called metadata files. TUF metadata
files contain additional information, including information about which keys
are trusted, the cryptographic hashes of files, signatures on the metadata,
metadata version numbers, and the date after which the metadata should be
considered expired.</p>

<p>When a software update system using TUF wants to check for updates, it asks TUF
to do the work. That is, your software update system never has to deal with
this additional metadata or understand what’s going on underneath. If TUF
reports back that there are updates available, your software update system can
then ask TUF to download these files. TUF downloads them and checks them
against the TUF metadata that it also downloads from the repository. If the
downloaded target files are trustworthy, TUF hands them over to your software
update system. See <a href="/metadata.html">Metadata</a> for more information and examples.</p>
