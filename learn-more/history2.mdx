      A predecessor technology of Uptane, The Update Framework (TUF), which
      secures software updates on repositories, is introduced in an
      [academic research paper](../static/papers/samuel_ccs_2010.pdf),
      coauthored by Justin Samuel and Justin Cappos.

    Cappos, along with Trishank Kuppusamy, and Vladimir Diaz begin
    adapting TUF for Python, Ruby, and environments used for cloud
    computing. Kuppusamy, a Ph.D. student at the time, will later use
    this experience on the Uptane project.

      NYU Tandon receives a grant (with Cappos as PI) from the U.S.
      Department of Homeland Security to begin work on a project to
      secure software updates on vehicles. University of Michigan
      Transportation Research Institute(UMTRI) and Southwest Research
      Institute(SWRI) receive a similar grant to work on automotive
      security.

          A consortium of researchers at UMTRI, SWRI, and NYU Tandon
          begin developing Uptane, using the basic TUF design as a
          starting point.
    </p>
    <p>
        The research team also begins holding a series of workshops
        (organized by Andre Weimerskirch at UMTRI) at which auto companies,
         suppliers, and representatives of government agencies meet to
         review and comment on the work in progress. The team also
         establishes an online forum, where issues could be raised and
         discussed. Both of these steps help to ensure
         alignment with the intended market.

        [_Uptane: Securing Software Updates for Automobiles_](../static/papers/kuppusamy_escar_16.pdf)
        is presented at [escar Europe](https://www.escar.info/escar-europe/history.html)
        by lead author Kuppusamy. This marked the first presentation of the
        project to an academic audience.

        Advanced Telematic Systems (ATS), now [HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/),
        becomes one of the first suppliers to publicly [acknowledge adoption](https://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2017/06/connected-car-news-marvell-telit-att-ats-continental-toyota-marvel-safe-drive-systems-cast-car2go-trimble/)
        of Uptane when it integrates the framework into two of its OTA
        solutions, OTA Plus and ATS Garage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Uptane is named one of the year's most important security innovations
        by [_Popular Science_](https://www.popsci.com/top-security-innovations-2017/).

        [Airbiquity](https://www.airbiquity.com) receives a
        [BIG Award for Business](https://www.airbiquity.com/news/press-releases/airbiquity-otamatic-named-2017-new-product-year-business-intelligence-group)
        in the 2017 New Product of the Year Award category for its
        Uptane-based OTAmatic over-the-air software and data management
        solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        An open source, C++ implementation of Uptane called [aktualizr](https://github.com/uptane/aktualizr)
        is developed by Advanced Telematic Systems (subsequently acquired by
        [HERE technologies](https://www.here.com/en)). aktualizr
        is integrated into [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/) (AGL),
        a collaborative open source project in which
        automakers, suppliers and technology companies work together to
        advance the development and adoption of a fully open software stack
        for the connected car.

        NYU Tandon School of Engineering becomes an associate member
        of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)
        and a Bronze member of AGL on the strength of the Foundationâ€™s
        adoption of Uptane and TUF projects.

    <p>
        The Uptane Alliance, a nonprofit entity organized under the umbrella of
        IEEE's [International Standards and Technology Organization](https://ieee-isto.org/)
        is formed. As an ISTO supported organization, the Alliance will
        oversee the development of a Standard for the implementation/deployment
        of Uptane, as well as the advancement and improvement of the
        technology itself.
