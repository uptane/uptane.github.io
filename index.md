#### Uptane hosted a free online workshop on March 31 entitled "A Conversation on End-to-End Secure Automotive Software Updates." The slide decks for the conference can be accessed as follows: [Introductory/Uptane](https://uptane.github.io/papers/23uptane_331_ms.pdf), [Supply chain overview](https://uptane.github.io/papers/23uptane_331_mackay.pdf), and [SBOM overview](https://uptane.github.io/papers/23uptane_331_hart.pdf). 

#### Watch for more details on our next workshop, to be held June 23 in the Detroit area following the escar USA meeting.

#### The Uptane Standard team has also prepared a survey to help us determine where to focus our outreach initiatives for 2023. Please [click here](https://forms.gle/nASmibdFY8B61RTT6) to complete the survey and be sure to share the link with your colleagues as well.
=======================

Uptane is an open and secure software update framework design which protects software delivered over-the-air to
automobile electronic control units (ECUs).  The framework protects against malicious actors who can
compromise servers and networks used to sign and deliver updates.  Hence, it is designed to be resilient even to the best efforts of nation state
attackers. There are multiple different free open source and closed source
implementations available.  Uptane is integrated into [Automotive Grade Linux](https://www.automotivelinux.org/),
an open source system currently used by many large OEMs, and has also been adopted by a number of U.S. and international manufacturers.

Uptane was first created in 2016 in a collaboration between [NYU](https://engineering.nyu.edu/), [UMTRI](https://www.umtri.umich.edu/), [SwRI](https://www.swri.org/), and automotive industry experts. It was developed as an open source framework under a grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It expands on [The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.io/), used in many production software update systems. In July 2018, formal standardization of Uptane began under a non-profit consortium called the [Uptane
Alliance](https://ieee-isto.org/member_programs/uptane-alliance/). [Uptane Standard for Design and Implementation](https://github.com/uptane/uptane-standard/releases/download/1.0.0/ieee-isto-6100.1.0.0.uptane-standard.html) version 1.0, which presents procedures for secure design and implementation of the framework, was released on July 31, 2019, under the auspices of the [IEEE/ISTO Federation](https://ieee-isto.org/). The initiative now
continues as a Linux Foundation Joint Development Foundation project, with versions [1.1.0](/papers/uptane-standard.1.1.0.html) and [1.2.0](/papers/uptane-standard.1.2.0.html) released in 2021. The most recent version, [2.0.0](/papers/uptane-standard.2.0.0.html) was released in March 2022. Recommended deployment strategies are under active development, and are published and regularly updated [on this site](/deployment-considerations/index.html). All Uptane materials, including [technical papers](https://uptane.github.io/publications.html), and
[security audits](https://uptane.github.io/audits.html) are also freely available for all to use without a fee.
